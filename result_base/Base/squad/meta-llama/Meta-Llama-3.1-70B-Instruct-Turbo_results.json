Established in 1825 in Brooklyn on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, it is one of America's longest serving military forts. Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers as well as for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station.

            "question": "Q: Allied submarines did not adopt a defensive posture and wait for the enemy to attack. Within hours after the Pearl Harbor attack, in retribution against Japan, Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis-controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors.[nb 13] At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific the Dutch Admiral in charge of the naval defense of the East Indies, Conrad Helfrich, gave instructions to wage war aggressively. His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together, an exploit which earned him the nickname \"Ship-a-day Helfrich\".

Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements\". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.What do auxins do?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",

The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters. The Sophists proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism; the belief in Euhemerism (the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes), became popular. The popular philosopher Epicurus promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia. The apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth. While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes.What is the view \"that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes\" called?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",

This figure is based on Pew Research, which is a reputable source for demographic and religious data. However, the accuracy can depend on the methodology used and the willingness of individuals to identify their religious beliefs.\n\n2. **Muslim Population**: The official statistics provided in the text indicate that 4% of the population identifies as Muslim. However, the US State Department's 2010 international religious freedom report suggests that this figure may underestimate the actual number of Muslims. Independent researchers estimate the Muslim population to be between 6 to 10% of the total population. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the official 4% figure.\n\n3. **Traditional Animistic Beliefs and Other Religions**: The text mentions that 1% of the population follows traditional animistic beliefs and 2% follow other religions, including Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and East Asian religions. These figures are relatively small and might be subject to underreporting due to the nature of these beliefs and practices, which can be more private or less formally organized.\n\n4. **Jehovah's Witnesses and Jewish Community**: The presence of Jehovah's Witnesses with about 80 congregations and a branch office, as well as a tiny Jewish community with a synagogue, indicates a level of religious diversity. However, these groups are not included in the percentage breakdowns provided, suggesting that the percentages might not fully capture the extent of religious diversity.\n\nGiven these considerations, the percentages provided in the text may not be entirely accurate for estimating the size of nonconformist religious groups for several reasons:\n\n- **Underestimation**: There are indications that certain groups, such as Muslims, might be underestimated in the official statistics.\n- **Methodological Limitations**: The accuracy of the percentages can depend on the methodology used in the surveys or reports, including how questions are phrased and how respondents identify their religious beliefs.\n- **Private or Less Formal Beliefs**: Some religious beliefs or practices might be less likely to be reported due to their private nature or because they do not fit neatly into categorized religious groups.\n\nTherefore, while the percentages provide a general idea of the religious landscape, they should be interpreted with caution and considered as rough estimates rather than precise figures.\n\n\\boxed{No}",

Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2).

In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilizations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" (from which the word \"auspicious\" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events. They may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.
