Within hours after the Pearl Harbor attack, in retribution against Japan, Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis-controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors.[nb 13] At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific the Dutch Admiral in charge of the naval defense of the East Indies, Conrad Helfrich, gave instructions to wage war aggressively. His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together, an exploit which earned him the nickname \"Ship-a-day Helfrich\".

Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister.

Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements\". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.What do auxins do?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",

In these designs, the reflective surface is created by the end of a conductor, normally a thin metal wire or rod, which in the simplest case has a feed point at one end where it is connected to a transmission line. The conductor, or element, is aligned with the electrical field of the desired signal, normally meaning it is perpendicular to the line from the antenna to the source (or receiver in the case of a broadcast antenna).What type of surface is formed by the tip of a conductor?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",

Conflicts between an individual fitness and signaling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behavior are \"honest\" traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviors.What is intersexual selection also known as?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": " Intersexual selection is also known as female choice.\n\nExplanation:\nIntersexual selection is a type of sexual selection where the preference of one sex (usually females in animals) determines which individuals of the other sex (usually males) will be chosen as mates. This process often leads to the evolution of elaborate traits in the chosen sex, such as the peacock's extravagant tail feathers. The term \"female choice\" is used to describe this specific type of intersexual selection because it emphasizes the role of females in driving the evolution of these traits.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Intersexual selection is also known as female choice.\n\nI will store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}:\n\\boxed{Intersexual selection is also known as female choice.}",

Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established. It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.What distinguishes Federalism from other types of government?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": " \\boxed{answer} Federalism is distinguished from other types of government by the following features:\n\n1. Division of Powers: In federalism, power is divided between the central government and regional governments. Both levels of government have distinct authorities and exercise them independently.\n\n2. Equality of Status: The central government and regional governments have equal status. Neither level is subordinate to the other. This is reflected in the fact that both have the power to make and enforce laws in their respective spheres.\n\n3. Self-Governance: Regional governments in a federal system have the power to govern themselves. They have autonomy in certain areas and are not merely administrative arms of the central government.\n\n4. Constitutionally Entrenched: The division of powers and the status of both levels of government are constitutionally entrenched. This means that they cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government or any regional government.\n\n5. Dual Citizenship: In a federal system, citizens often have dual citizenship, belonging both to the country as a whole and to their regional government.\n\nThese features distinguish federalism from other forms of government, such as unitary systems where the central government holds most or all of the power, and confederations where the regional governments have more power than the central government.",

The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a \"critical text\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.

Then on 25 November 1837, Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement, having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms, who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father, Samuel Ryland Phipson, a friend of Claridge, was also \"instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement (in 1836)\". Indeed, mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge, but without success.Where had Claridge previously seen asphalt used as pavement?\n\nPlease solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": " Claridge had previously seen asphalt used as pavement in France and Belgium.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The question states that Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt for pavement in 1837.\n2. It also mentions that Claridge had seen this material employed in France and Belgium before.\n3. This information is further supported by the fact that Claridge was not the first to introduce asphalt pavement to Britain; mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge.\n4. Therefore, given the timeline and the information about Claridge's travels, it is reasonable to conclude that Claridge had previously seen asphalt used as pavement in France and Belgium.",

At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed.
