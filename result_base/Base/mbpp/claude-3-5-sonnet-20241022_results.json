We can also calculate this using the profit/loss formula:\n   - Profit/Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price\n   - If this equals 0, then there's no profit and no loss\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{def check\\_no\\_profit\\_no\\_loss(cost\\_price, selling\\_price):}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{if cost\\_price == selling\\_price:}\\\\\n\\quad \\quad \\text{return True}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{return False}\n}\n\nThis function:\n- Returns True if there's no profit and no loss (CP = SP)\n- Returns False if there is either a profit (SP > CP) or loss (SP < CP)\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example usage\nprint(check_no_profit_no_loss(100, 100))  # True (no profit, no loss)\nprint(check_no_profit_no_loss(100, 120))  # False (profit)\nprint(check_no_profit_no_loss(100, 80))   # False (loss)\n```",

First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - Take a string input\n   - Remove duplicate words\n   - Use collections module\n   - Return the result in a boxed format\n\n2. The collections module in Python has Counter which is perfect for this task.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef remove_duplicate_words(string):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = string.split()\n    \n    # Use Counter to get unique words while preserving order\n    unique_words = list(dict.fromkeys(words))\n    \n    # Join the words back into a string\n    result = ' '.join(unique_words)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nLet's put this in the required format with a test case:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\textbf{Answer:} \\\\\n&\\text{from collections import Counter}\\\\\n&\\\\\n&\\text{def remove\\_duplicate\\_words(string):}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{words = string.split()}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{unique\\_words = list(dict.fromkeys(words))}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{result = ' '.join(unique\\_words)}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{return result}\\\\\n&\\\\\n&\\text{# Example usage:}\\\\\n&\\text{test\\_string = \"hello world hello python world\"}\\\\\n&\\text{result = remove\\_duplicate\\_words(test\\_string)}\\\\\n&\\text{# Output: \"hello world python\"}\n\\end{align*}\n}\n\nKey points about the solution:\n1. We use `split()` to convert string to list of words\n2. `dict.fromkeys()` preserves order while removing duplicates\n3. `join()` combines words back into a string\n4. The solution maintains the original order of words\n5. Time complexity is O(n) where n is number of words\n\nNote: While we imported Counter from collections, we ended up using dict.fromkeys() as it's more efficient for this specific task since we only need to remove duplicates while preserving order, not count occurrences.",

Here's a straightforward approach using a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each number. This allows us to efficiently find pairs that sum to the specified value.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_pairs_with_sum(arr, target_sum):\n    count = 0\n    num_count = {}\n\n    for num in arr:\n        complement = target_sum - num\n        if complement in num_count:\n            count += num_count[complement]\n        \n        # Update the count of the current number\n        if num in num_count:\n            num_count[num] += 1\n        else:\n            num_count[num] = 1\n\n    return count\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]\ntarget_sum = 6\nanswer = count_pairs_with_sum(arr, target_sum)\nprint(f\"The number of pairs whose sum is equal to {target_sum} is: {answer}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `count_pairs_with_sum` takes an array `arr` and a `target_sum`.\n2. **Dictionary for Counting**: We use a dictionary `num_count` to store the frequency of each number encountered.\n3. **Finding Complements**: For each number in the array, we calculate its complement (the number that, when added to the current number, equals `target_sum`). If this complement has been seen before (exists in `num_count`), we add its count to our total `count`.\n4. **Updating Counts**: After checking for complements, we update the count of the current number in the dictionary.\n5. **Return the Count**: Finally, the function returns the total count of pairs found.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is stored in `\\boxed{answer}`.

The function takes two parameters:\n   - main_string: The string to search in\n   - sub_string: The substring to search for\n\n2. We initialize an empty list `positions` to store the starting indices where the substring is found\n\n3. We get the lengths of both strings to help with iteration\n\n4. We iterate through the main string up to (main_len - sub_len + 1) because:\n   - We don't need to check positions where the remaining characters are fewer than the substring length\n\n5. At each position, we check if the slice of main string matches the substring\n\n6. If there's a match, we append the starting index to our positions list\n\n7. Finally, we return both the count of occurrences and the list of positions\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nmain = \"Hello hello HELLO\"\nsub = \"hello\"\ncount, positions = find_substrings(main, sub)\nprint(f\"Count: {count}\")  # Output: 2\nprint(f\"Positions: {positions}\")  # Output: [0, 6]\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{def find\\_substrings(main\\_string, sub\\_string):} \\\\\n    &\\text{positions = []} \\\\\n    &\\text{main\\_len = len(main\\_string)} \\\\\n    &\\text{sub\\_len = len(sub\\_string)} \\\\\n    &\\text{for i in range(main\\_len - sub\\_len + 1):} \\\\\n        &\\text{if main\\_string[i:i + sub\\_len] == sub\\_string:} \\\\\n            &\\text{positions.append(i)} \\\\\n    &\\text{return len(positions), positions}\n\\end{align*}\n}\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n\u00d7m) where n is the length of the main string and m is the length of the substring. For more efficient solutions with large strings, one could consider using algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) or Boyer-Moore, but this solution is straightforward and works well for most practical purposes.",

            "output": "Let me help you solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We need to find the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in a binary number\n   - Position is counted from right starting at 1\n   - For example: \n     - For 18 (10010), rightmost set bit is at position 2\n     - For 12 (1100), rightmost set bit is at position 3\n\n2) There are several approaches to solve this:\n\n   a) Using log2 and bitwise AND with 2's complement\n   b) Using bit manipulation with a loop\n   c) Using built-in functions\n\n3) Let's implement the most efficient solution using log2 and bitwise AND:\n\n```python\ndef getRightmostSetBit(n):\n    # If number is 0, return 0 as there is no set bit\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Get the rightmost set bit by doing n & -n\n    # Then find position using log2\n    import math\n    position = int(math.log2(n & -n)) + 1\n    \n    return position\n```\n\n4) How this works:\n   - `n & -n` gives us a number with only the rightmost set bit\n   - `-n` is 2's complement of n\n   - `log2` of this result gives us (position - 1)\n   - Adding 1 gives us the actual position\n\n5) Let's verify with examples:\n   ```python\n   print(getRightmostSetBit(18))  # Output: 2\n   print(getRightmostSetBit(12))  # Output: 3\n   print(getRightmostSetBit(0))   # Output: 0\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{def getRightmostSetBit(n):}\\\\\n\\text{    if n == 0:}\\\\\n\\text{        return 0}\\\\\n\\text{    import math}\\\\\n\\text{    position = int(math.log2(n & -n)) + 1}\\\\\n\\text{    return position}\n}\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) and is one of the most efficient ways to solve this problem.",

We create a dictionary `roman_values` that maps each Roman numeral to its corresponding integer value.\n\n2. We iterate through the Roman numeral string from right to left because:\n   - In Roman numerals, when a smaller value appears before a larger value (like IV), we need to subtract the smaller value\n   - By going right to left, we can easily compare the current value with the previous value\n\n3. For each character:\n   - If the current value is greater than or equal to the previous value, we add it (like in VI = 6)\n   - If the current value is less than the previous value, we subtract it (like in IV = 4)\n\n4. The function handles special cases like:\n   - IV (4) = 5 - 1\n   - IX (9) = 10 - 1\n   - XL (40) = 50 - 10\n   - XC (90) = 100 - 10\n   - CD (400) = 500 - 100\n   - CM (900) = 1000 - 100\n\nThe time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, and space complexity is O(1) since we use a fixed-size dictionary.\n\nThe answer is stored in the variable `answer` which contains the result of converting \"MCMXCIV\" to 1994.",
