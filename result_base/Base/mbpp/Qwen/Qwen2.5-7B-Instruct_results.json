Each jump is of a fixed length, and we need to determine how many such jumps are required to reach the point \\((d, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Since each jump is of a fixed length and we are moving only along the x-axis (from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((d, 0)\\)), the number of jumps required is simply the distance \\(d\\) divided by the length of each jump. This is because each jump covers the same distance along the x-axis.\n\n3. **Formulating the Solution**: Let the length of each jump be \\(l\\). The number of jumps required to cover the distance \\(d\\) is given by the integer division of \\(d\\) by \\(l\\). If \\(d\\) is exactly divisible by \\(l\\), the number of jumps is \\(\\frac{d}{l}\\). If \\(d\\) is not exactly divisible by \\(l\\), it means we cannot reach the exact point \\((d, 0)\\) with the given jump length, and the problem would be undefined or require a different interpretation (e.g., rounding up to the next integer).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: Assuming \\(d\\) is exactly divisible by \\(l\\), the number of jumps required is \\(\\frac{d}{l}\\).\n\nLet's write the function in a pseudocode format:\n\n```pseudocode\nfunction numberOfJumps(d, l):\n    if d % l == 0:\n        return d // l\n    else:\n        return \"Cannot reach the point exactly\"\n```\n\nSince the problem statement does not specify what to do if \\(d\\) is not exactly divisible by \\(l\\), we will assume the simplest case where \\(d\\) is exactly divisible by \\(l\\).

The children of a node at index `i` are located at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement this check:\n\n1. **Define the function**: We'll define a function `is_min_heap` that takes an array as input and returns `True` if the array represents a min heap, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Check each node**: We'll iterate through the array and check if each node satisfies the min heap property. We'll start from the first non-leaf node, which is at index `floor((n-2)/2)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n\n3. **Verify the children**: For each node, we'll check if its value is less than or equal to the values of its children. If any node violates this condition, we return `False`.\n\n4. **Return the result**: If all nodes satisfy the min heap property, we return `True`.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_min_heap(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Start from the first non-leaf node\n    start_index = (n - 2) // 2\n    \n    # Check each node from the last non-leaf node to the root\n    for i in range(start_index, -1, -1):\n        left_child_index = 2 * i + 1\n        right_child_index = 2 * i + 2\n        \n        # Check left child\n        if left_child_index < n and arr[i] > arr[left_child_index]:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check right child if it exists\n        if right_child_index < n and arr[i] > arr[right_child_index]:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nprint(is_min_heap(arr))  # Output: True\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 4]\nprint(is_min_heap(arr))  #",

            "output": "To solve the problem of finding the position of the rightmost set bit in a given integer, we can use bitwise operations. Here's a step-by-step approach to create a Python function for this:\n\n1. **Identify the Rightmost Set Bit**: We need to find the rightmost bit that is set to 1. This can be done by using a bitwise AND operation between the number and its two's complement (number - 1).\n\n2. **Find the Position**: Once we have the rightmost set bit, we can determine its position by counting the number of bits from the right until we reach this bit.\n\nHere is the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef get_rightmost_set_bit_position(n):\n    # Ensure n is a non-negative integer\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer\")\n    \n    # Find the rightmost set bit\n    rightmost_set_bit = n & -n\n    \n    # If the number is 0, there are no set bits\n    if rightmost_set_bit == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the rightmost set bit\n    position = 0\n    while rightmost_set_bit > 0:\n        rightmost_set_bit >>= 1\n        position += 1\n    \n    return position\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 18  # Binary: 10010\nprint(get_rightmost_set_bit_position(n))  # Output: 1 (0-indexed)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Step 1**: The expression `n & -n` isolates the rightmost set bit. This works because `-n` in two's complement form flips all the bits of `n` and adds 1, so `n & -n` will have only the rightmost set bit of `n` set to 1.\n- **Step 2**: We then count the number of right shifts needed to make `rightmost_set_bit` zero. Each right shift moves the rightmost set bit to the right, and we count the number of shifts.\n\n### Example:\nFor `n = 18` (binary `10010`):\n- `18 & -18` gives `2` (binary `00010`).\n- We then count the number of right shifts needed to make `2` zero, which is 1",
