The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D plane is given by |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of jumps required to reach a point of the form (d, 0) from the origin (0, 0). Since the y-coordinate is always 0, the only movement we need to consider is along the x-axis.\n\nEach jump has a fixed length, let's call it 'jumpLength'. To reach the point (d, 0) from the origin, we need to cover a distance of d along the x-axis.
