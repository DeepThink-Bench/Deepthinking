The idea is to iterate through each character in the string. When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack. The maximum size of the stack at any point gives us the deepest level of nesting.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a string of multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n    It returns a list where each element represents the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group.\n\n    :param paren_string: A string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n    :return: A list of integers representing the deepest level of nesting for each group.\n    \"\"\"\n    groups = paren_string.split()  # Split the input string into groups\n    result = []  # Initialize a list to store the results\n    \n    for group in groups:\n        max_depth = 0  # Initialize the maximum depth for the current group\n        current_depth = 0  # Initialize the current depth\n        stack = []  # Initialize a stack\n        \n        for char in group:\n            if char == '(':  # If the character is an opening parenthesis\n                stack.append(char)  # Push it onto the stack\n                current_depth += 1  # Increase the current depth\n                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)  # Update the maximum depth\n            elif char == ')':  # If the character is a closing parenthesis\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack\n                current_depth -= 1  # Decrease the current depth\n        \n        result.append(max_depth)  # Append the maximum depth for the current group to the result list\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]\n```\n\n\\boxed{[2, 3, 1, 3]}",

            "output": "To solve the problem, we need to write a function that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 +... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nHere is the Python function that implements this formula:\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sum.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n. The formula is implemented using the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which calculates the sum directly without the need for a loop.\n\nNow, let's test the function with the examples provided:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465\nprint(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050\nprint(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15\nprint(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nAll the test cases pass, which means our function is working correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{sum_to_n(n: int) -> int: return n * (n + 1) // 2}$",

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. We can start from any cell and move to any of its neighbor cells. We need to find the path that has the smallest lexicographical order.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n    min_path = [float('inf')] * k\n\n    def dfs(i, j, path):\n        nonlocal min_path\n        if len(path) == k:\n            if path < min_path:\n                min_path = path[:]\n            return\n        for di, dj in directions:\n            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:\n                dfs(ni, nj, path + [grid[ni][nj]])\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])\n\n    return min_path\n```\n\nThis solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths of length k. It keeps track of the minimum path found so far and updates it whenever a smaller path is found.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * 4^k), where n is the size of the grid and k is the length of the path. This is because we are exploring all possible paths of length k, and each path can have up to 4 possible next steps.\n\nThe space complexity is O(k), which is the maximum depth of the recursion stack.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\ngrid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nk = 3\nprint(minPath(grid, k))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]\n\ngrid = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]\nk = 1\nprint(minPath(grid, k))  # Output: [1]\n```\n\n\\boxed{[1, 2, 1]}",
