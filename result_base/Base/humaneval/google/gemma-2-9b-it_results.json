We only need to check divisibility up to the square root because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n\n5. **`if length % i == 0:`**: Inside the loop, this line checks if the `length` is divisible by `i` without a remainder.

This ensures that we don't modify the original array.\n2. **Sort the copy:** We use the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the copied array in ascending order. This gives us a sorted version of the array.\n3. **Check the sum:** We calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the original array (`array[0] + array[-1]`).\n4. **Reverse if even:** If the sum is even, we reverse the sorted array using `new_array.reverse()`. This effectively sorts the array in descending order.\n5. **Return the result:** Finally, we return the sorted (either ascending or descending) array.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n* The `sorted()` function efficiently sorts the array in ascending order.\n* The conditional check (`if (array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0`) determines whether the sum is even or odd, allowing us to apply the appropriate sorting order",

If it is, it simply returns `n`. This is the base case of our recursion, as the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1 respectively.\n\n* **Recursive Step:** If `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates the nth Fibonacci number by recursively calling itself twice:\n    * `fib(n-1)`: Calculates the (n-1)th Fibonacci number.\n    * `fib(n-2)`: Calculates the (n-2)th Fibonacci number.\n   The function then returns the sum of these two results, which is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers or have any more questions!",

It also includes examples of how to use the function.\n\n3. **Normalization:**\n   - `text = text.lower().replace(\" \", \"\")` converts the input string to lowercase and removes any spaces. This ensures that the palindrome check is case-insensitive and ignores spaces.\n\n4. **Palindrome Check:**\n   - `return text == text[::-1]` compares the normalized string with its reversed version (`text[::-1]`). If they are equal, the string is a palindrome, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The function takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input.\n\n2. **Iterative Process:**\n   - The `while b:` loop continues as long as `b` is not zero.\n   - Inside the loop:\n     - `a, b = b, a % b`: This line performs two operations simultaneously:\n       - It assigns the value of `b` to `a`.\n       - It calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` (`a % b`) and assigns it to `b`.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - When `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates. At this point, the value of `a` holds the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`. The function returns this value.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say we want to find the GCD of 25 and 15:\n\n1. `a = 25`, `b = 15`\n2. `a = 15`, `b = 25 % 15 = 5`\n3. `a = 5`, `b = 15 % 5 = 0`\n4. `b` is now 0, so the loop ends. The GCD is `a`, which is 5.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. The `decode_shift` function needs to reverse this process.\n\n**The Solution**\n\n1. **Iterate through the string:** The code uses a list comprehension to process each character (`ch`) in the input string `s`.\n\n2. **Calculate the shifted character:**\n   - `ord(ch)`: Gets the numerical Unicode value of the character.\n   - `ord(\"a\")`: Gets the Unicode value of 'a'.\n   - `(ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"a\"))`:  Subtracts 5 from the character's Unicode value and adjusts for the starting point ('a').\n   - `% 26`:  Uses the modulo operator (%) to wrap around the alphabet. If the result is negative, it adds 26 to ensure it stays within the range of lowercase letters.\n   - `+ ord(\"a\")`: Adds the Unicode value of 'a' back to get the Unicode value of the decoded character.\n\n3. **Convert to character:** `chr(...)` converts the Unicode value back into a character.\n\n4. **Join the characters:** `\"\".join(...)` combines all the decoded characters back into a single string.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see more examples or have any other questions!",

Think of it like two ships passing in the night \u2013 they might be close, but they don't collide in the traditional sense.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nSince the cars are moving at the same speed and the road is infinite, every car traveling left to right will eventually encounter every car traveling right to left.  \n\nTherefore, the number of collisions is simply the number of cars in each set multiplied together.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.

If it is, `b` cannot be a substring of `a`, so we return `False`.\n\n2. **Substring Search:** We iterate through the first word (`a`) using a sliding window of size `len(b)`.  For each window, we compare it to the second word (`b`). If they match, we've found a substring and return `True`.\n\n3. **Rotation Handling:**  The key to handling rotations is the `temp` and `b` assignment.  We store the original `b` in `temp` and then rotate `b` by shifting the characters one position to the right and adding the first character to the end. This effectively checks all possible rotations of `b`.\n\n4. **Final Check:** If we complete the loop without finding a match, it means none of the rotations of `b` are substrings of `a`, so we return `False`.\n\n\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n\n$\\boxed{answer = \\text{The provided Python code}}$",
