            "output": "Water vapor is the gaseous phase of water.  It's invisible.  Clouds are made of tiny water droplets or ice crystals, *formed from* water vapor, but they are not water vapor itself.  Snow and ice are solid forms of water. Cigarette smoke contains water vapor, but it's mixed with other particulate matter, making the vapor itself not directly visible.\n\nTherefore, none of the options are directly visible examples of *just* water vapor. However, the closest option is **A. aerial clouds**, as they are formed by condensation of water vapor.

The onion's state of matter remains the same.\n* **B. when food is digested by the stomach:** Digestion involves chemical changes, breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones.  It's not a phase change.\n* **C. when water is added to a glass:** Adding water to a glass is a physical change, altering its location and possibly temperature, but not its phase.
