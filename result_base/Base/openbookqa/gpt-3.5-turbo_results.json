However, this alone may not necessarily lead to a significant increase in competition among lions.\n\nOption B: When the population of lions decreases, competition among the remaining lions may indeed become more intense as they compete for limited resources. This scenario is more likely to result in fierce competition among lions.\n\nOption C: Having a plethora of prey choices may actually reduce competition among lions as there is an abundance of food available, leading to less intense competition.\n\nOption D: If antelopes are scarce, competition among lions may increase as they compete for the limited food source.
