Whether this is positive or negative depends on the context. \n\n* **Positive:** If the current tone is dull or lacking excitement, Mr. Taylor's attempt could be seen as a positive change.\n* **Negative:** If the original tone was appropriate or the \"thriller's rush\" is jarring or out of place, it could be perceived negatively.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nSince the question asks for a simple positive/negative judgment, we need to assume a neutral context.

What Kieslowski aspired to could be seen as positive (e.g., deeper understanding of human nature) or negative (e.g., a sense of existential despair).\n\n* **\"Condition of Art\" is Broad:**  The \"condition of art\" is a vast concept.  Kieslowski's films might be seen as pushing artistic boundaries in a positive way, or they might be seen as challenging or even undermining traditional notions of art.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause Kieslowski's work is open to interpretation and the sentence itself is phrased in a way that allows for multiple readings, it's impossible to say for sure whether the sentiment is positive or negative. \n\n\nTherefore,  \\boxed{answer} =  **indeterminate** \n",
