Key phrases and connotations:\n- \"cold porridge\" - generally negative, implies unappetizing\n- \"only the odd\" - limiting phrase, suggests scarcity of good elements\n- \"chewy lump\" - in porridge, lumps are usually considered undesirable\n- The simile compares something to an unappetizing dish\n- The overall tone is critical and negative\n\n2. Analysis:\n- The sentence uses a food metaphor to describe something as mostly unpleasant\n- Even the one potentially positive element (\"enjoyably chewy\") is described as rare (\"odd\")\n- The comparison to cold porridge is particularly negative since porridge is typically served hot\n- The presence of lumps in porridge is generally considered a flaw in preparation\n\n3.

First, let's analyze the sentence \"is simply too overdone\"\n   - The phrase \"too overdone\" has a negative connotation\n   - \"Simply\" emphasizes the negative sentiment\n   - When something is \"overdone\", it implies excess or going beyond what's desirable\n\n2.

However, the second part \"should not be missed\" is a strong recommendation, suggesting that despite (or because of) these intense emotional elements, the film is worth watching.\n\n3.

The ability to evoke strong emotions is often seen as a mark of powerful filmmaking.\n\n4. The key phrase \"should not be missed\" is definitively positive - it's recommending that people watch the film.\n\n5.
