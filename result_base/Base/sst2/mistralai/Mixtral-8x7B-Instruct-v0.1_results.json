Here is a positive story:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a beautiful and peaceful village, there lived a kind and generous farmer. He had a large and bountiful farm, where he grew a variety of crops and raised many animals. The farmer was well-respected and loved by all in the village, for he was always willing to share his abundance with those in need.\n\nOne day, a severe drought struck the village, causing all the crops to wither and die. The villagers were worried, as they did not have enough food to last them through the dry season. The farmer, however, was not discouraged. He knew that there must be a way to help his fellow villagers.\n\nThe farmer traveled to a nearby town, where he sold some of his animals in order to buy seeds that were resistant to drought. He returned to his village and planted the seeds, caring for them day and night.\n\nMiraculously, the seeds sprouted and grew into strong and healthy plants, providing the villagers with a bountiful harvest. The farmer's selflessness and determination had saved the village from starvation.\n\nFrom that day on, the villagers honored the farmer as a hero, and they all lived happily ever after.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1, as this story is positive. \\boxed{answer = 1}",
