The text describes a work (likely a film or a book) that has been stripped of nudity, profanity, and violence, but still manages to make some points about modern man and his quest for human connection. The tone seems to be one of acknowledgment that despite the limitations, the work still achieves something meaningful.\n\nThe sentence does not explicitly state whether the work is good or bad, but it does imply that the work has some merit by mentioning that it still manages to make points. This suggests a positive sentiment, as the work is not entirely dismissed despite the removal of certain elements.\n\nGiven the instruction that a positive answer is 1 and a negative answer is 0, we can conclude that the sentiment is positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.",
