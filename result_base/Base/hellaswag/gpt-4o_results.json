You can even take turns hosting your party, but no one is guaranteed to get invited to the party and make the best impression.\"\n   - This option focuses on the guest list and hosting turns, which is relevant but not directly related to the immediate task of planning with friends.\n\n3. \"They will help you plan where the party will occur and get you started.

This approach encourages communication and addressing the issue directly, which can be effective in resolving conflicts.\n\n2. **Option 1**: This option recommends using \"I statements\" to express how you feel about your sister's behavior. For example, saying \"I feel belittled when you talk to me like a little kid\" or \"I feel angry when you choose not to respect my clothing.\" This approach is constructive as it focuses on expressing personal feelings without blaming the other person, which can help in resolving conflicts.\n\n3. **Option 2**: This option suggests giving it a rest and resuming being civil if it has been at least two months since the last argument. While taking a break can sometimes help, it does not address the underlying issues directly.\n\n4. **Option 3**: This option advises ignoring your sister's calls if she is constantly emailing or calling you names like 'fatty' or 'heartless.' Ignoring can help avoid immediate conflict, but it does not resolve the issue and may lead to further resentment.\n\nConsidering the effectiveness of each approach in resolving conflicts, **Option 1** is the most reasonable scenario outcome.
