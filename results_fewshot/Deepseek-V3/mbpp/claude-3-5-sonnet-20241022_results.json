Since the movement is along the x-axis, the y-coordinate remains 0.\n\n2. **Calculate the Distance**: The distance between the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and the point \\((d, 0)\\) is simply \\(|d|\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Jumps**: The number of jumps required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the ratio of the distance to the jump length.

If \\(L = 0\\), it is impossible to make progress unless \\(d = 0\\).\n\n5. **Implement the Function**: We can implement this logic in a function.\n\nHere is the Python function to compute the number of jumps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef number_of_jumps(d, L):\n    if L == 0:\n        return 0 if d == 0 else float('inf')  # Infinite jumps if L is 0 and d is not 0\n    return math.ceil(abs(d) / L)\n\n# Example usage:\nd = 10\nL = 3\nanswer = number_of_jumps(d, L)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input**: The function takes two inputs: \\(d\\) (the distance to the point) and \\(L\\) (the length of each jump).\n- **Output**: The function returns the minimum number of jumps required to reach the point \\((d, 0)\\).\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - If \\(L = 0\\) and \\(d \\neq 0\\), it is impossible to reach the point, so the function returns infinity.\n  - If \\(d = 0\\), no jumps are needed, so the function returns 0.\n\n### Example:\nFor \\(d = 10\\) and \\(L = 3\\), the function calculates \\(\\lceil 10 / 3 \\rceil = 4\\).\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

We need to find minimum jumps of length L to reach point (d,0) from (0,0)\n2. Since we're moving to (d,0), we only care about horizontal distance\n3. Key insights:\n   - The absolute distance to cover is |d|\n   - Each jump is of length L\n   - We need to find ceiling(|d|/L) to get minimum jumps\n4. Edge cases:\n   - If L = 0: impossible unless d = 0\n   - If d = 0: no jumps needed\n\n### Answer:\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_jumps(d, L):\n    if L == 0:\n        return 0 if d == 0 else float('inf')\n    return math.ceil(abs(d) / L)\n```\n\nThe final answer in \\boxed{min_jumps(d, L)}\n\nFor example:\n- If d = 10 and L = 3:\n  - |d|/L = 10/3 \u2248 3.33\n  - ceil(3.33) = 4 jumps needed\n- If d = -5 and L = 2:\n  - |d|/L = 5/2 = 2.5\n  - ceil(2.5) = 3 jumps needed\n\nThis solution is optimal because:\n1. It handles all edge cases\n2. Uses math.ceil() for precise rounding up\n3. Takes absolute value to handle negative distances\n4. Returns float('inf') when impossible (L=0, d\u22600)",

However, the given solution is incomplete because:\n   - Just checking c = a is not sufficient\n   - We need to verify that the equation actually has real roots\n   - For real roots, discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) must be \u2265 0\n\n3. The complete solution should:\n   - Check if c = a (reciprocal condition)\n   - Verify the discriminant is non-negative\n   - Return True only if both conditions are met\n\n### Answer:\nHere's the correct implementation:\n\n```python:solution.py\ndef are_roots_reciprocal(a, b, c):\n    # Check if equation has real roots (discriminant \u2265 0)\n    discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c\n    \n    # Check both conditions:\n    # 1. c = a (for reciprocal roots)\n    # 2. discriminant \u2265 0 (for real roots)\n    return c == a and discriminant >= 0\n\n# Example usage:\n# For equation 2x\u00b2 - 5x + 2 = 0\na, b, c = 2, -5, 2\nanswer = are_roots_reciprocal(a, b, c)\nprint(f\"Are the roots reciprocal? {answer}\")  # Output: True\n```\n\nThe final answer is stored in \\boxed{def are_roots_reciprocal(a, b, c): return c == a and b*b - 4*a*c >= 0}\n\nThis solution is more robust because:\n1.

It handles all possible quadratic equations correctly\n\nFor example:\n- 2x\u00b2 - 5x + 2 = 0 returns True (roots are 2 and 1/2)\n- x\u00b2 + 1 = 0 returns False (complex roots)\n- x\u00b2 - x + 1 = 0 returns False (complex roots)\n- x\u00b2 - 5x + 1 = 0 returns False (roots aren't reciprocal)",

Key considerations:\n   - Need to handle cases where k might be out of bounds for some tuples\n   - Need to initialize product as 1 since we're multiplying\n   - Should iterate through each tuple and multiply the kth elements\n3. The solution should be concise and efficient\n\n### Answer:\nThe most elegant and efficient solution would be a one-liner using list comprehension and the `math.prod()` function from Python's math module. However, for better readability and to handle edge cases explicitly, I'll provide a standard function approach.\n\nThe final answer in \\boxed{\n```python\ndef product_of_kth_index(tuples_list, k):\n    product = 1\n    for t in tuples_list:\n        if k < len(t):\n            product *= t[k]\n    return product\n```\n}\n\nThis solution:\n1. Takes a list of tuples and index k as input\n2. Safely handles tuples of different lengths\n3. Returns the product of all kth elements\n4. Has O(n) time complexity where n is the number of tuples\n5. Is easy to understand and maintain\n\nWhen used with the example input:\n```python\ntuples = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]\nk = 1\n```\nIt will return 80 (2 * 5 * 8)",

Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef swap_nth_elements(lst):\n    # Iterate through the list in steps of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(lst) - 1, 2):\n        # Swap the n-th and (n+1)th elements\n        lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]\n    return lst\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = swap_nth_elements(input_list)\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function `swap_nth_elements` takes a list `lst` as input.\n2. It iterates through the list in steps of 2 using a `for` loop.\n3. During each iteration, it swaps the current element (`lst[i]`) with the next element (`lst[i + 1]`).\n4. The modified list is returned as the result.\n\n### Example:\nFor the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function will swap the elements as follows:\n- Swap 1 and 2 \u2192 `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Swap 3 and 4 \u2192 `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6]`\n- Swap 5 and 6 \u2192 `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]`\n\nThe final output is `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Here's a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef most_frequent_item(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return None  # Return None if the list is empty\n    counter = Counter(lst)\n    most_common = counter.most_common(1)\n    return most_common[0][0]\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3]\nresult = most_frequent_item(lst)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Counter**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each element in the list.\n2. **most_common(1)**: The `most_common(1)` method returns a list of the most common elements and their counts.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Define the function**: The function will take one parameter, which is the given even number.\n2. **Generate even numbers**: Use a loop or list comprehension to generate all even numbers up to the given number.\n3. **Calculate the average**: Sum the even numbers and divide by the count of even numbers.\n4. **Return the result**: The function will return the calculated average.\n\nHere is the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef average_of_evens(n):\n    # Ensure n is even\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return \"Input must be an even number.\"\n    \n    # Generate even numbers up to n\n    evens = [i for i in range(2, n + 1, 2)]\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    average = sum(evens) / len(evens)\n    \n    return average\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = average_of_evens(10)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 6.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `average_of_evens` first checks if the input `n` is even. If not, it returns an error message.\n- It then generates a list of even numbers from 2 up to `n` using a list comprehension.\n- The average is calculated by summing the list of even numbers and dividing by the number of elements in the list.\n- Finally, the function returns the average.\n\n### Storing the Final Answer:\nThe final answer is the function itself, which can be used to calculate the average of even numbers up to any given even number.

First, let's analyze what we need:\n   - A function that takes an even number as input\n   - Validates if the input is even\n   - Finds all even numbers up to that number\n   - Calculates their average\n\n2. Key considerations:\n   - Input validation is important\n   - We need to handle edge cases\n   - The solution should be efficient\n   - The result should be a float for accurate average\n\n3. Mathematical approach:\n   - Even numbers sequence: 2, 4, 6, ..., n\n   - Count of numbers = n/2\n   - Sum formula can be used: (first + last) \u00d7 count/2\n\n## Answer\n\nWe can optimize the solution using the mathematical formula instead of generating a list:\n\nThe final answer in \\boxed{\n```python\ndef average_of_evens(n):\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return \"Input must be an even number\"\n    count = n // 2\n    return (2 + n) / 2\n```\n}\n\n## Explanation\n\nThis solution is more efficient than the list comprehension approach because:\n1. It uses constant space O(1) instead of O(n)\n2. It uses the arithmetic sequence formula\n3. It's more concise while maintaining readability\n4. It handles the validation properly\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(average_of_evens(10))  # Output: 6.0\nprint(average_of_evens(6))   # Output: 4.0\nprint(average_of_evens(3))   # Output: \"Input must be an even number\"\n```\n\nThe formula works because:\n- For n=10, even numbers are [2,4,6,8,10]\n- Average = (2 + 10)/2 = 6.0\n- This matches with the sum/count method: (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 30/5 = 6.0",

We expand the window by moving `right` and shrink it by moving `left` when the condition `arr[right] - arr[left] > k` is violated.\n3. **Max Window Size**: We keep track of the maximum window size where the condition is satisfied.\n4. **Result**: The minimum number of elements to remove is the total number of elements minus the size of the largest valid window.\n\nFor the example `arr = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]` and `k = 5`, the largest valid window is `[1, 3, 6]` with a size of 3.

If all characters match the first character, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\nHere is the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef all_characters_same(s):\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return True\n    first_char = s[0]\n    for char in s:\n        if char != first_char:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check for Empty String**: If the string is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no characters to compare.\n2. **First Character**: The first character of the string is stored in `first_char`.\n3. **Comparison Loop**: The function iterates through each character in the string and compares it to `first_char`.\n4. **Return Result**: If any character does not match `first_char`, the function returns `False`. If all characters match, it returns `True`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(all_characters_same(\"aaaa\"))  # Output: True\nprint(all_characters_same(\"aaba\"))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring):\n    occurrences = []\n    start_index = 0\n    while True:\n        index = main_string.find(substring, start_index)\n        if index == -1:\n            break\n        occurrences.append((index, index + len(substring)))\n        start_index = index + 1\n    return occurrences\n\n# Example usage:\nmain_string = \"hello world hello\"\nsubstring = \"hello\"\nresult = find_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring)\nboxed_answer = f\"Occurrences and positions: {result}\"\nprint(boxed_answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `find_substring_occurrences` takes two arguments: `main_string` (the string to search within) and `substring` (the substring to search for).\n2. **Initialization**: An empty list `occurrences` is initialized to store the positions of the substring.\n3. **Loop**: A `while` loop is used to repeatedly search for the substring starting from `start_index`.\n4. **Finding Substring**: The `find` method is used to locate the substring. If the substring is found, its starting and ending indices are appended to the `occurrences` list.\n5. **Update Start Index**: The `start_index` is updated to continue searching from the next character.\n6. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the substring is no longer found (`find` returns `-1`).\n7. **Return**: The function returns the list of tuples containing the start and end positions of each occurrence.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the example usage provided, the output will be:\n```\nOccurrences and positions: [(0, 5), (12, 17)]\n```\n\nThis indicates that the substring \"hello\" occurs twice in the main string, starting at positions 0 and 12, and ending at positions 5 and 17, respectively.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

            "question": "Given the question statement:Write a python function to check whether every even index contains even numbers of a given list.\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that checks whether every even index in a given list contains an even number. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Iterate through the list**: We will loop through the list, specifically checking the elements at even indices.\n2. **Check if the number is even**: For each element at an even index, we will check if it is even.\n3. **Return the result**: If all elements at even indices are even, the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\nHere is the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_indices(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `check_even_indices` takes a list `lst` as input.\n- The `for` loop iterates over the list starting from index 0 and increments by 2 (i.e., it only checks even indices).\n- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current index is not even (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`). If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`.\n- If the loop completes without finding any odd number at even indices, the function returns `True`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(check_even_indices([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: True\nprint(check_even_indices([2, 3, 5, 5, 6]))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Here, we'll store it in a variable named `answer`.\n\n```python\nanswer = is_perfect_square(number)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Example Output:\nFor `number = 16`, the output will be:\n```\n\\boxed{True}\n```\n\nFor `number = 18`, the output will be:\n```\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef max_uppercase_run(s):\n    max_run = 0\n    current_run = 0\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            current_run += 1\n            if current_run > max_run:\n                max_run = current_run\n        else:\n            current_run = 0\n    \n    return max_run\n\n# Example usage:\n# result = max_uppercase_run(\"abcDEFGhiJKLMNop\")\n# print(result)  # Output: 5\n\nanswer = max_uppercase_run(\"abcDEFGhiJKLMNop\")\n```\n\nThe function `max_uppercase_run` iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is uppercase, it increments the `current_run` counter. If the `current_run` exceeds the `max_run`, it updates `max_run`. If the character is not uppercase, it resets `current_run` to 0.

We need to create a function that calculates the average of numbers in a list\n2. Key considerations:\n   - Handle empty list case to avoid division by zero\n   - Sum all numbers efficiently\n   - Perform division with list length\n3. Python's built-in `sum()` function is optimal for summing list elements\n4. Using len() gives us the count of elements\n5. The formula is: average = sum of all numbers / count of numbers\n\n### Answer:\nThe most concise and efficient solution would be:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers): return sum(numbers)/len(numbers) if numbers else 0\n```\n\nThis can be written in \\boxed{def calculate_average(numbers): return sum(numbers)/len(numbers) if numbers else 0}\n\nThe solution is elegant because:\n1. It uses a ternary operator to handle empty list case\n2. Utilizes built-in functions for optimal performance\n3. Returns 0 for empty lists to avoid errors\n4. Performs the calculation in a single line while maintaining readability\n5. Follows Python's principle of explicit being better than implicit\n\nFor example:\n- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n- Output: 3.0 (because (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3.0)",

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef subtract_nested_tuples(t):\n    if isinstance(t, tuple):\n        return tuple(subtract_nested_tuples(element) for element in t)\n    else:\n        return -t  # Subtract the element by returning its negation\n\n# Example usage:\nnested_tuples = ((1, 2), (3, (4, 5)))\nresult = subtract_nested_tuples(nested_tuples)\nprint(result)  # Output: ((-1, -2), (-3, (-4, -5)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function `subtract_nested_tuples` checks if the input `t` is a tuple.\n2. If it is a tuple, it recursively applies the function to each element of the tuple.\n3.

Iterate through all numbers from `1` to `n`.\n2. For each number, convert it to its binary representation.\n3. Count the number of unset bits (`0`s) in the binary representation.\n4.

Only includes elements that appear more than once (count > 1)\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example:\nt = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 3)\ncount_repeated(t)  # Output: {2: 2, 3: 3}\n```\n\nThe solution is both memory-efficient and follows the format requested in the examples. It's a one-liner that clearly expresses the intent while maintaining readability.",

In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.\n2. **Extract elements from the heap**: Repeatedly remove the largest element from the heap (which is the root of the heap) and place it at the end of the array. After each extraction, restore the heap property.\n3. **Repeat until the heap is empty**: Continue the process until all elements are extracted and the array is sorted.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the heap sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef heapify(arr, n, i):\n    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root\n    left = 2 * i + 1  # left child\n    right = 2 * i + 2  # right child\n\n    # If left child exists and is greater than root\n    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = left\n\n    # If right child exists and is greater than largest so far\n    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = right\n\n    # If largest is not root\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)  # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree\n\ndef heap_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Build a max-heap\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    # Extract elements one by one\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]\nheap_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **heapify function**: This function ensures that the subtree rooted at index `i` is a max-heap. It compares the root with its left and right children and swaps if necessary, then recursively heapifies the affected subtree.\n2. **heap_sort function**: This function first builds a max-heap from the array. Then, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element (root of the heap) and places it at the end of the array, reducing the heap size by one each time and restoring the heap property.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\n\\boxed{\ndef heapify(arr, n, i):\n    largest = i\n    left = 2 * i + 1\n    right = 2 * i + 2\n\n    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = left\n\n    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = right\n\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)\n\ndef heap_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines the `heapify` and `heap_sort` functions to sort an array using the heap sort algorithm.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

We need to find the shortest word length in a string, which requires:\n   - Breaking the string into individual words\n   - Comparing lengths of all words\n   - Handling edge cases (empty string)\n2. We can optimize this by:\n   - Using string.split() for word separation\n   - Using min() with a key function instead of manual iteration\n   - Making it a one-liner for efficiency\n\n### Answer:\nThe most elegant and efficient solution would be:\n\n```python\ndef shortest_word_length(s): return min(len(word) for word in s.split()) if s.strip() else 0\n```\n\nThis can be written as \\boxed{def shortest_word_length(s): return min(len(word) for word in s.split()) if s.strip() else 0}\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function uses a generator expression with min() to find the shortest length\n2. s.strip() handles edge cases by checking if the string is empty or only whitespace\n3. The if-else ensures we return 0 for empty strings\n4. This solution is:\n   - More concise than the iterative approach\n   - Memory efficient due to generator expression\n   - Handles all edge cases\n   - Maintains readability\n\n### Test Cases:\n```python\nassert shortest_word_length(\"This is a test string\") == 1  # \"a\" has length 1\nassert shortest_word_length(\"Python programming\") == 6     # \"Python\" has length 6\nassert shortest_word_length(\"\") == 0                       # Empty string returns 0\nassert shortest_word_length(\"   \") == 0                    # Whitespace returns 0\n```\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1} for the example string \"This is a test string\".",

We then iterate through the Roman numeral string, summing the values while handling subtractive combinations (e.g., \"IV\" for 4, \"IX\" for 9).\n\nHere\u2019s the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    roman_to_int_map = {\n        'I': 1,\n        'V': 5,\n        'X': 10,\n        'L': 50,\n        'C': 100,\n        'D': 500,\n        'M': 1000\n    }\n    total = 0\n    prev_value = 0\n    for char in reversed(s):\n        current_value = roman_to_int_map[char]\n        if current_value < prev_value:\n            total -= current_value\n        else:\n            total += current_value\n        prev_value = current_value\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = roman_to_int(\"MCMXCIV\")\nprint(result)  # Output: 1994\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We use a dictionary `roman_to_int_map` to map each Roman numeral character to its integer value.\n2. We initialize `total` to store the result and `prev_value` to keep track of the previous character's value.\n3. We iterate through the string in reverse order. For each character:\n   - If the current value is less than the previous value, it means we have a subtractive combination (e.g., \"IV\"), so we subtract the current value from `total`.\n   - Otherwise, we add the current value to `total`.\n4.
