            "question": "Given the question statement:Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve the problem of determining the number of jumps required to reach a point of the form \\((d, 0)\\) from the origin \\((0, 0)\\) in a 2D plane, where each jump is of a given length \\(L\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the minimum number of jumps of length \\(L\\) required to reach the point \\((d, 0)\\) from the origin. Since the movement is along the x-axis, the y-coordinate remains 0.\n\n2. **Calculate the Distance**: The distance between the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and the point \\((d, 0)\\) is simply \\(|d|\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Jumps**: The number of jumps required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the ratio of the distance to the jump length. This can be calculated using the ceiling function.\n\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If \\(d = 0\\), no jumps are needed. If \\(L = 0\\), it is impossible to make progress unless \\(d = 0\\).\n\n5. **Implement the Function**: We can implement this logic in a function.\n\nHere is the Python function to compute the number of jumps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef number_of_jumps(d, L):\n    if L == 0:\n        return 0 if d == 0 else float('inf')  # Infinite jumps if L is 0 and d is not 0\n    return math.ceil(abs(d) / L)\n\n# Example usage:\nd = 10\nL = 3\nanswer = number_of_jumps(d, L)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input**: The function takes two inputs: \\(d\\) (the distance to the point) and \\(L\\) (the length of each jump).\n- **Output**: The function returns the minimum number of jumps required to reach the point \\((d, 0)\\).\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - If \\(L = 0\\) and \\(d \\neq 0\\), it is impossible to reach the point, so the function returns infinity.\n  - If \\(d = 0\\), no jumps are needed, so the function returns 0.\n\n### Example:\nFor \\(d = 10\\) and \\(L = 3\\), the function calculates \\(\\lceil 10 / 3 \\rceil = 4\\).\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Since the movement is along the x-axis, the y-coordinate remains 0.\n\n2. **Calculate the Distance**: The distance between the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and the point \\((d, 0)\\) is simply \\(|d|\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Jumps**: The number of jumps required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the ratio of the distance to the jump length.

The function will then extract the kth element from each tuple and compute the product of these elements.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef product_of_kth_index(tuples_list, k):\n    product = 1\n    for t in tuples_list:\n        if k < len(t):  # Ensure the kth index exists in the tuple\n            product *= t[k]\n    return product\n\n# Example usage:\ntuples = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]\nk = 1\nresult = product_of_kth_index(tuples, k)\nprint(f\"The product of the {k}th index elements is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1.

We expand the window by moving `right` and shrink it by moving `left` when the condition `arr[right] - arr[left] > k` is violated.\n3. **Max Window Size**: We keep track of the maximum window size where the condition is satisfied.\n4. **Result**: The minimum number of elements to remove is the total number of elements minus the size of the largest valid window.\n\nFor the example `arr = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]` and `k = 5`, the largest valid window is `[1, 3, 6]` with a size of 3.

The output will be `3`, indicating that `6` should be inserted at index `3`.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

A triangular number is a number that can be represented as a triangle with dots. The `k`-th triangular number is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest index `k` such that \\( T_k \\) has exactly `n` digits.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n1. **Generate triangular numbers**: We will generate triangular numbers using the formula \\( T_k = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \\).\n2. **Check the number of digits**: For each triangular number, we will check if it has exactly `n` digits.\n3. **Find the smallest index**: We will continue generating triangular numbers until we find the smallest `k` where \\( T_k \\) has `n` digits.\n\n### Python Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_smallest_triangular_index(n):\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2\n        if math.floor(math.log10(triangular_number)) + 1 == n:\n            return k\n        k += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 3\nanswer = find_smallest_triangular_index(n)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`math.log10(triangular_number)`**: This gives the logarithm base 10 of the triangular number.

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef find_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring):\n    occurrences = []\n    start_index = 0\n    while True:\n        index = main_string.find(substring, start_index)\n        if index == -1:\n            break\n        occurrences.append((index, index + len(substring)))\n        start_index = index + 1\n    return occurrences\n\n# Example usage:\nmain_string = \"hello world hello\"\nsubstring = \"hello\"\nresult = find_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring)\nboxed_answer = f\"Occurrences and positions: {result}\"\nprint(boxed_answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `find_substring_occurrences` takes two arguments: `main_string` (the string to search within) and `substring` (the substring to search for).\n2. **Initialization**: An empty list `occurrences` is initialized to store the positions of the substring.\n3. **Loop**: A `while` loop is used to repeatedly search for the substring starting from `start_index`.\n4. **Finding Substring**: The `find` method is used to locate the substring. If the substring is found, its starting and ending indices are appended to the `occurrences` list.\n5. **Update Start Index**: The `start_index` is updated to continue searching from the next character.\n6. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the substring is no longer found (`find` returns `-1`).\n7. **Return**: The function returns the list of tuples containing the start and end positions of each occurrence.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the example usage provided, the output will be:\n```\nOccurrences and positions: [(0, 5), (12, 17)]\n```\n\nThis indicates that the substring \"hello\" occurs twice in the main string, starting at positions 0 and 12, and ending at positions 5 and 17, respectively.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Iterate through the list**: We will loop through the list, specifically checking the elements at even indices.\n2. **Check if the number is even**: For each element at an even index, we will check if it is even.\n3. **Return the result**: If all elements at even indices are even, the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\nHere is the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef check_even_indices(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `check_even_indices` takes a list `lst` as input.\n- The `for` loop iterates over the list starting from index 0 and increments by 2 (i.e., it only checks even indices).\n- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current index is not even (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`). If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`.\n- If the loop completes without finding any odd number at even indices, the function returns `True`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(check_even_indices([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: True\nprint(check_even_indices([2, 3, 5, 5, 6]))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

The result is stored in the variable `result` and then formatted into the `\\boxed{}` syntax.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the input `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `m = 2`, and `n = 3`, the output will be:\n```\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. Additionally, we can keep track of the length of the subarray that yields this maximum sum.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_length(arr):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    start = 0\n\n    for end in range(len(arr)):\n        current_sum += arr[end]\n\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            max_length = end - start + 1\n\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n            start = end + 1\n\n    return max_length\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2]\nresult = max_subarray_length(arr)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{result}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity to handle cases where all elements are negative.\n   - `current_sum` keeps track of the sum of the current subarray.\n   - `max_length` stores the length of the subarray with the maximum sum.\n   - `start` is the starting index of the current subarray.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   - Add the current element to `current_sum`.\n   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` and calculate the length of the current subarray (`end - start + 1`).\n   - If `current_sum` becomes negative, reset it to 0 and move the `start` index to the next element.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - The function returns the length of the subarray with the maximum sum.\n\n### Example:\nFor the array `[1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2]`, the subarray with the maximum sum is `[3, 5, -1, 2]`, which has a length of 4.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

The result is a new nested tuple with all elements subtracted.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

The idea is to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `str1` and `str2`, and then use it to determine the length of the shortest string that contains both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**\n   - The LCS of `str1` and `str2` is the longest sequence of characters that appears in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.\n   - Let the length of the LCS be `lcs_length`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of the Shortest String:**\n   - The length of the shortest string that contains both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{length} = \\text{len(str1)} + \\text{len(str2)} - \\text{lcs_length}\n     \\]\n\n### Python Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef shortest_common_supersequence_length(str1, str2):\n    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)\n    \n    # Create a DP table to store lengths of LCS\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # Length of the shortest common supersequence\n    lcs_length = dp[m][n]\n    return len(str1) + len(str2) - lcs_length\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"abc\"\nstr2 = \"ac\"\nresult = shortest_common_supersequence_length(str1, str2)\nprint(f\"The length of the shortest common supersequence is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `dp` table is used to store the lengths of the LCS for different substrings of `str1` and `str2`.\n- The final value `dp[m][n]` gives the length of the LCS of the entire strings `str1` and `str2`.\n- The length of the shortest common supersequence is then calculated using the formula mentioned above.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.\n2. **Extract elements from the heap**: Repeatedly remove the largest element from the heap (which is the root of the heap) and place it at the end of the array. After each extraction, restore the heap property.\n3. **Repeat until the heap is empty**: Continue the process until all elements are extracted and the array is sorted.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the heap sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef heapify(arr, n, i):\n    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root\n    left = 2 * i + 1  # left child\n    right = 2 * i + 2  # right child\n\n    # If left child exists and is greater than root\n    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = left\n\n    # If right child exists and is greater than largest so far\n    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = right\n\n    # If largest is not root\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)  # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree\n\ndef heap_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Build a max-heap\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    # Extract elements one by one\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]\nheap_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **heapify function**: This function ensures that the subtree rooted at index `i` is a max-heap. It compares the root with its left and right children and swaps if necessary, then recursively heapifies the affected subtree.\n2. **heap_sort function**: This function first builds a max-heap from the array.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_evens(l, r):\n    total = 0\n    for num in range(l, r + 1):\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nl = 1\nr = 10\nanswer = sum_of_evens(l, r)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `sum_of_evens` takes two arguments, `l` (the lower bound) and `r` (the upper bound).\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of even numbers.\n3. **Iteration**: A `for` loop iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).\n4. **Check for Even Numbers**: Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current number `num` is even by using the modulus operator `%`.\n5. **Summation**: If the number is even, it is added to `total`.\n6. **Return the Result**: The function returns the total sum of even numbers.\n7. **Example Usage**: The function is called with `l = 1` and `r = 10`, and the result is stored in `answer` and printed in the required format.\n\n### Output:\nFor the example where `l = 1` and `r = 10`, the sum of even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) is 30.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n                                ## Question:\n                                Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                We need to check if a string contains all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
