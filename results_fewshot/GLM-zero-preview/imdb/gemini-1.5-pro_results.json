            "question": "Given the question statement:This is my all-time favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; like I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket and Let's Face the Music and Dance. If I remember correctly, this was the film that introduced me to Fred Astaire so I suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr*p but I'm woman so get over it)All in all this film gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was superb and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more awesome.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question. We're asked to determine whether the given sentence is positive or negative, with a positive answer being 1 and a negative answer being 0.\n\nWait, the text provided is actually a full review of a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film, not a single sentence. The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer describes it as their \"all-time favorite\" film,\u79f0\u8d5e the dialogue as \"cute and funny and very clever.\" They mention that the film contains \"some of the best songs recorded by the two,\" specifically naming \"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket\" and \"Let's Face the Music and Dance.\" The reviewer also reveals a personal connection, stating that this was the film that introduced them to Fred Astaire, which makes it hold a \"special place in my heart.\" Even the aside about being sentimental is lighthearted and doesn't detract from the overall positivity.\n\nFurthermore, the choreography is described as \"superb,\" and the presence of Lucille Ball is highlighted as making the film \"even more awesome.\" The reviewer gives the film an 8/10, which is a high rating. Despite the initial instruction to consider only the last sentence, it's clear that the entire review sets the context for that sentence.\n\nHowever, the last sentence is indeed the key: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, this is a bit of a trick. The sentence we need to evaluate is \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" But what exactly is \"this sentence\"?\n\nLet's parse it carefully. The sentence is referring to itself, creating a self-referential statement. It's essentially asking, \"Is this sentence positive?\" and providing instructions based on the answer. But is the sentence itself positive or negative?\n\nLet's consider the content. The sentence is neutral in tone; it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about the film or anything else. It's simply providing a key for interpreting a response. It doesn't contain any emotional language or\u8bc4\u4ef7 of the film. It's an instruction or a question about how to answer.\n\nMy first instinct was to consider the entire review, but the question specifically asks about the sentence provided. Even though the review is positive, we need to focus on the last sentence. Trying to apply the review's positivity to the sentence feels like a stretch.\n\nThinking further, perhaps the sentence is neutral. It's not positive or negative; it's asking a question or providing instructions. Even if we consider the context of the positive review, the sentence itself doesn't convey a positive or negative sentiment.\n\nBut wait, maybe the sentence is positive because it's offering a way to indicate a positive\u8bc4\u4ef7. However, that's stretching it. The sentence is neutral.\n\nLet's consider alternative interpretations. Maybe \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review. But the question specifically asks about the sentence provided, which is the last one.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I keep coming back to the fact that the sentence is neutral. It's not positive or negative. It's asking a question or providing instructions.\n\nHowever, the options are to answer 1 for positive or 0 for negative. Since the sentence is neutral, neither option seems fully appropriate. But given the instructions, we need to choose between 1 and 0.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the context of the positive review. Since the review is positive, and the sentence is part of the review, we might infer that the sentence is positive. But that's stretching it.\n\nWait, maybe the sentence is positive because it's offering a way to indicate a positive\u8bc4\u4ef7. But that's still a stretch.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

We're given a text that seems to be a review of a film, and we need to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. If it's positive, the answer is 1; if it's negative, the answer is 0.\n\nFirst, let's break down the text:\n\n1. **\"Well, what to say...\"**\n   - This opening is quite vague and doesn't immediately indicate a positive or negative sentiment. It sets the stage for the reviewer to express their thoughts.\n\n2. **\"Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was??\"**\n   - Wait, this is a strong indication of confusion and dissatisfaction. The use of \"what the hell\" and the double question mark emphasize the reviewer's frustration with the film's purpose or meaning.\n\n3. **\"V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick... Round and Round and Round.... You get the idea...\"**\n   - Oh, this is clearly negative. The reviewer describes the camera moves as \"dodgy,\" which is a British slang term for \"suspicious\" or \"questionable.\" They even had to look away because they felt physically sick, and the repetition of \"Round and Round and Round\" underscores their discomfort. This is a strong negative reaction to the filmmaking technique.\n\n4. **\"VERY VERY Strange accents at many points.... 'Those that should know, know'\"**\n   - The use of capital letters for \"VERY VERY Strange\" emphasizes the reviewer's annoyance with the accents. The phrase \"'Those that should know, know'\" is likely a reference to something in the film, but it comes across as cryptic and off-putting, adding to the negative tone.\n\n5. **\"Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...\"**\n   - This is a clear recommendation against watching the film unless you have a compelling reason to do so, like getting it for free or being forced to watch it as a punishment. The comparison to being made to paint the house is a humorous but negative way of saying it's not worth watching otherwise.\n\n6. **\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\"**\n   - This final sentence is the instruction for the task. We need to determine if the overall sentiment of the text is positive or negative.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses confusion about the film's point, disgust with the camera work, annoyance with the accents, and a strong recommendation against watching it unless absolutely necessary. There are no positive comments to balance out these negatives.\n\nMy first instinct is that this review is negative, and breaking it down only reinforces that. Even the opening, which seems hesitant, doesn't offer any positive vibes. The reviewer doesn't mention anything they liked about the film, and the overall tone is one of frustration and disappointment.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's consider the possibility of any hidden positivity. Could the reviewer be using sarcasm? Perhaps saying \"Unless you're getting in for free, or being paid to watch it\" is meant to be ironic, implying the film is actually great? Wait, but that doesn't fit with the rest of the review. If the film were great, the reviewer wouldn't describe the camera work as making them feel sick or the accents as strange.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate it. The review is filled with negative language and criticisms. The only way to interpret \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is to consider the overall sentiment of the text.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot.

I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review. At first glance, the title \"I don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said\" sets a pretty negative tone. The user mentions they \"have only myself to be angry with\" for watching it, which is more self-reproach than anything else, but it reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nWait, they admit they should have known better when they saw the title, suggesting the title itself was a red flag. But they \"loved War Games\" and decided to indulge their whim, which is a nice touch\u2014shows they're not entirely closed off to the idea. However, the next sentence is a bit extreme: \"I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life.\" Okay, that's pretty negative.\n\nFrom there, the review gets even worse. The premise is mocked: \"when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot.\" The use of \"land-that-good-writing-forgot\" is a clever way to say the writing was atrocious.\n\nThe list of \"very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it.\" That's a strong statement, emphasizing just how bad everything was. The user even challenges others: \"To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.\" Ouch, that's harsh. They're essentially saying they can't imagine anything worse, which is a pretty negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, there's a moment where I almost thought there might be a twist. The user mentions they loved War Games and indulged their whim, which could be seen as a positive thing. But then they immediately follow it with regretting the decision for the rest of their life. So, any potential positivity is swiftly squashed.\n\nThey also mention that the title should have warned them, but they hoped for something like War Games. That initial hope quickly fades when the movie starts. The opening scene alone confirmed their worst fears. The list of bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so extensive that they couldn't even list them all without crashing IMDb. That's a hyperbole, but it drives home how bad the movie was.\n\nThey're so curious to find something worse that they openly ask for recommendations, which suggests they can't believe anything could be worse than this. It's like they're daring someone to top it, but they don't really think anything can. The user is clearly disappointed and frustrated, and their language reflects that.\n\nI did briefly wonder if there might be some sarcasm or hidden positivity, but everything points to a scathing review. They even use the phrase \"steaming pile of horse dung,\" which leaves no doubt about their opinion. The mention of War Games is more a setup for how much worse this movie was, not a testament to its quality.\n\nSo, after all that, is this sentence positive or negative? The overwhelming sentiment is negative. The user expresses regret, disappointment, and frustration with the movie. They mock the premise, the writing, the plot lines, the dialog, and the acting. The only positive mention is their love for War Games, but that's used to contrast how bad this movie is.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the \"classic\" 50s \"alien invasion\" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail (\"Casino Royale\", \"Our Man Flint\" are worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet. (*1/2)If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review to determine whether it's positive or negative. The review is for a comedy that spoofs classic 50s alien invasion films. Right off the bat, the description \"sloppily directed, witless comedy\" sets a negative tone. The use of \"sloppily\" and \"witless\" are clear criticisms of the film's direction and humor.\n\nThe review mentions that the film \"supposedly spoofs the 'classic' 50s 'alien invasion' films,\" implying that it doesn't succeed in its goal. It goes on to say, \"but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects).\" So, while the makeup effects get a nod, the overall quality is deemed no better than the films it's spoofing. Wait, perhaps the film isn't entirely bad?\n\nHowever, the next part pours cold water on any lingering hope. The review compares the film to other spoofs that are worse than their targets, like \"Casino Royale\" and \"Our Man Flint\" being worse than James Bond movies. By drawing this comparison, the reviewer is suggesting that this comedy is also worse than the films it's spoofing. This seems to confirm that the film fails in its comedic mission.\n\nThen we have the screeching alien voices. The reviewer states, \"After two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for some peace and quiet.\" This is a clear negative, emphasizing how irritating the sound design is.\n\nLet's not forget the rating: \"(*1/2)\". That's a rating of 1.5 stars out of 5, which is pretty dismal. Even though there's a mention of good makeup effects, the overall tone is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer seems to be saying that while the technical aspects might be decent, the film is witless, sloppily directed, and worse than the films it's spoofing.\n\nInitially, I thought the mention of good makeup effects might be a saving grace, but then I remembered that any positive aspect is overshadowed by the negative. The reviewer's comparison to other spoofs that are worse than their targets drives home the point that this film doesn't succeed in its genre. The screeching alien voices are just the cherry on top of the negative sundae.\n\nWait, maybe the reviewer is being sarcastic when they mention the good makeup effects?

            "question": "Given the question statement:SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review to determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The review for \"Sweet Sixteen\" (1983) is quite critical, starting with the description of the plot: a fifteen-year-old bad girl named Melissa moves to a desert town where people start dying, and the detective's daughter helps solve the mystery. The local Native Americans are prime suspects, and the killings lead up to the revelation of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.\n\nThe reviewer describes the movie as \"below average\" and \"not too memorable,\" which already sets a negative tone. They mention it has a \"made for TV feel,\" which isn't a compliment, especially when paired with the observation that the only notable score is Melissa's \"corny theme song\" that plays a couple of times throughout. The dialogue is criticized for lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw,\" which fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays\u2014a not-so-subtle indication that the movie is formulaic and unoriginal.\n\nWait, the reviewer also points out some plot holes and inconsistencies, such as Marci calling Melissa a bad name and then immediately developing a friendship because Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This seems a bit forced and doesn't add much to the story. Additionally, the movie's depiction of Native Americans is criticized for lacking depth; the social commentary isn't developed enough to be taken seriously.\n\nMoreover, the reviewer notes that the movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. This suggests that the movie is exploitative and perhaps doesn't handle its subject matter maturely.\n\nHowever, the reviewer does mention that they are \"too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets,\" which implies that they think the movie is overrated. They also compare it to \"Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday,\" suggesting that both movies had the potential to capitalize on the birthday party theme to create an intense sequence of carnage but failed to deliver.\n\nBut wait, there's a bit of a silver lining at the end. The reviewer mentions that releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow. This could be seen as a positive note, acknowledging that despite the movie's flaws, its release contributes to the preservation and availability of lesser-known films.\n\nHowever, when we consider the final sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" we need to determine whether the sentence itself is positive or negative. The sentence is essentially a instruction or a prompt, not a statement expressing an opinion. It's asking the reader to judge whether a certain sentence is positive or negative and to provide an answer based on that judgment.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some ambiguity here. The sentence refers to \"this sentence,\" which could be interpreted as referring to the entire review or just the preceding sentence. But given the context, it seems to be a meta-comment, instructing the reader on how to respond to the review.\n\nHowever, considering the overall tone of the review, which is overwhelmingly negative, and the fact that the final sentence is more of an instruction than an opinion, it's reasonable to conclude that the answer is negative.\n\nAfter analyzing the review, it's clear that the movie is panned for being below average, formulaic, and exploitative. The social commentary is criticized, and the movie is compared unfavorably to others in its genre. The positive note about the release of obscure movies on DVD is a bit of a consolation, but it doesn't outweigh the negative aspects of the review.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The movie had \"so much emotion\" and \"felt so real,\" allowing the reviewer to \"sympathize with the characters.\" Every time they watch it, the ending makes them cry, and they can \"really identify with Busy Philipps' character.\" These are all strong indicators of a positive emotional response.\n\nWait, the reviewer even goes on to say, \"I think that all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing.\" This suggests they believe the movie has an important message and societal value. They \"recommend this movie to everybody and anybody,\" which is a straightforward positive recommendation. Specifically, they recommend it to \"those who have been affected by any school shooting,\" showing empathy and\u8ba4\u4e3a the movie resonates with those who have experienced such tragedies.\n\nThe review concludes with a superlative: \"It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time.\" There's no doubt here\u2014the reviewer holds the movie in the highest regard.\n\nHowever, let's consider the content of the movie itself. It's about a school shooting, which is a tragic and disturbing topic. At one point, I thought, \"Wait, am I missing some underlying sarcasm or criticism?\" Could the reviewer be critiquing the movie's handling of such a sensitive subject? But the language used is consistently positive. They don't mention any flaws or dislikes. Even the emotional impact\u2014the fact that the ending makes them cry\u2014is presented as a positive aspect.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is aware that the movie deals with heavy subject matter, but they're praising it for how it handles that content. The fact that they think it should be shown in high schools suggests they believe it has educational value and can prevent real-life tragedies.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the reviewer might be criticizing the movie indirectly by highlighting its emotional impact, but that doesn't make sense. They explicitly state that they loved the movie, bought it immediately, and recommend it to everyone. The mention of school shootings is part of the movie's content, not a criticism of it.\n\nIn the end, the review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses phrases like \"absolutely loved,\" \"so much emotion,\" \"felt so real,\" \"recommend to everybody,\" and \"one of the greatest movies of all time.\" There's no hint of negativity or criticism.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises.

I just hope I don't have to wait 10 more years for it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem by analyzing the text to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. The user provides a review of Hal Hartley's film \"Fay Grim,\" which is a sequel to \"Henry Fool.\" The review is filled with praise and admiration for the film and its director.\n\nThe reviewer starts by expressing their admiration for Hal Hartley's films, specifically mentioning \"Henry Fool.\" They note that \"Fay Grim\" has a similar style and sense of humor, which is likely a good thing given their appreciation for the first film. The plot is described as \"completely different,\" which could be positive or negative depending on context, but here it seems to be presented neutrally.\n\nThe main character, Fay Grim, is played by Parker Posey, whom the reviewer describes as \"iconic,\" and her performance is praised as \"brilliant.\" The reviewer enjoys the plot, where Fay tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks and gets entangled in conspiracies and espionage. This suggests they found the story engaging and intriguing.\n\nThe supporting cast is also applauded as \"excellent,\" with the reviewer mentioning familiar faces from the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and Elina Lowensohn, whose return is described as \"much-welcomed.\" The film is said to have \"lots of surprises,\" which is generally a positive attribute, indicating it's unpredictable and keeps the viewer engaged.\n\nThe director's claim that this is part of a \"Star Wars\"-like trilogy, with \"Fay Grim\" serving as the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the series, is met with enthusiasm. The reviewer expresses excitement about the potential third installment, hoping not to wait too long for it. This eagerness suggests they thoroughly enjoyed the film and are looking forward to more.\n\nThroughout the review, there's not a single negative comment. The reviewer doesn't mention any dislikes or criticisms. Even when they express hope that they won't have to wait 10 more years for the third installment, it's not a complaint about the film itself but rather an eagerness for more content.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's make sure we're not missing any hidden negativity. The reviewer doesn't use any negative language or imply any dissatisfaction with the film. They don't compare it unfavorably to other films or express any regrets about watching it. Every aspect they mention is praised.\n\nI briefly considered whether the phrase \"the plot, however, is completely different\" might be negative, but there's no indication that the reviewer sees this as a bad thing. They're simply stating a fact about the film's plot compared to the first one, and given their overall positive tone, it's likely meant in a neutral or positive light.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the potential for the review to be mixed, but there's just no negative content here. The mention of the third installment is purely anticipatory and doesn't imply any negatives about \"Fay Grim.\"\n\nIn the end, the review is overwhelmingly positive.

They're excited about the potential sequel and can't wait to see more.\n\nSo, considering the user's instructions\u2014if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1; if negative, the answer is 0\u2014the final answer is clear.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The review mentions that it's the \"touching story of two families,\" which immediately sets a warm and emotional tone. The fact that it's about \"the relationships within each family\" suggests a focus on the human connections that are often at the heart of compelling dramas.\n\nThe review states that \"each family has a gay son,\" and \"the stories are interrelated at that point.\" This indicates that the shared experience of having gay sons is a central theme, but it's not the only focus. Importantly, the film is \"about all of the family members, not just the two sons.\" This broad scope suggests a well-rounded exploration of the families' dynamics.\n\nWe're told that \"the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn.\" This is a strong compliment, implying that the characters are complex and realistically portrayed. The reviewer also mentions that \"the story is consistently interesting,\" which is a clear positive. It keeps the audience engaged throughout.\n\nHowever, the review does include the phrase \"a bit bleak.\" This is a negative element, suggesting that the tone of the film is somber or depressing. But wait, is this enough to tip the review into the negative category?\n\nLet's consider the context. The bleakness might be inherent to the subject matter, and the reviewer doesn't seem to criticize the film for being bleak but rather states it as a fact. The reviewer doesn't elaborate on the bleakness or suggest that it detracts from the overall quality of the film.\n\nThinking about it, the review starts with positive aspects\u2014the touching story, the focus on relationships, the well-drawn portraits\u2014and only mentions the bleakness towards the end. It's possible that the reviewer sees the bleakness as a necessary part of the story rather than a flaw.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is saying that despite the bleakness, the film is consistently interesting. If the film were overly bleak or depressing, we might expect a stronger negative reaction. The use of \"a bit\" also softens the impact of the criticism.\n\nLet's also consider the overall tone of the review. It feels more positive than negative. The reviewer highlights several strengths of the film without mentioning any significant flaws beyond the bleakness, which seems to be part of the film's design.\n\nI did initially think the mention of \"bleak\" might make this a negative review, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The review seems to be saying the movie is good, with well-drawn characters and an interesting story, even if it's a bit depressing.\n\nLet's not overthink this. The review is more positive than negative. The \"bit bleak\" is outweighed by the positives.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

'Party of Five' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there's little rooting interest because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate bland awful-acting 'Wes Bentley' mopester. In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood.

Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question about the movie review. At first glance, the text seems to be a scathing critique, but to be sure, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe review starts by stating that without effective use of the supernatural or poetic elements, the creative team relies on \"middling, unoriginal elements.\" That's not a good sign. It compares the movie to 'Party of Five' gone maniacal and genetically unescapable, which immediately makes me think of a soap opera turned horror, but not in a good way.\n\nWait, the reviewer mentions there's \"little rooting interest\" because the singular non-homicidal character is a second-rate, bland, awful-acting 'Wes Bentley' mopester. Even though Wes Bentley is a talented actor, the review suggests his performance here is subpar. The review further states that \"all of the acting is skin deep,\" implying superficial performances.\n\nHowever, there's a slight positive note\u2014the dark-haired women are appealing, and the salaciousness is kept to a minimum with no nudity. But then it says there's also a lack of sufficient blood, which is odd for a horror movie. The sensations are kept at a \"teasing, safe distance,\" which is particularly unfortunate considering the directors are named \"butcher.\" That's a pretty strong hint that the movie missed the mark on delivering the gore or intensity one might expect.\n\nThe soundtrack gets a bit of praise\u2014it's droning, angsty alt-country and a tense fluctuating score that provides some palpable tension. Sometimes, the static storyboarded compositions with appealing low-angles add to the malaise. But overall, for a film that calls itself horror, the reviewer didn't even flinch once. That's a pretty damning statement.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is offering some constructive criticism: a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps for sympathetic characters to escape. These ideas might have improved the movie, but as it stands, this was not a good start to the reviewer's excursion through horrorfest.\n\nThe review concludes with a clear question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Let's consider the overall tone. The review is overwhelmingly critical, highlighting unoriginality, poor acting, lack of gore, and failure to deliver on the horror genre's expectations. The few positive mentions are faint and don't outweigh the negatives.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the mention of the appealing dark-haired women and the decent soundtrack, but these are minor positives in a sea of criticism. My initial instinct was that this review is negative, and breaking it down only reinforces that.\n\nEven though the review starts with \"Q:\" and ends with what seems like a multiple-choice question, it's actually a clever way to present the review and ask whether it's positive or negative. My first instinct was that it's negative, and after careful consideration, I'm confident that's the case.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The review starts with a bit of context: the person read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it, and since they're home sick, watching the Lifetime movie adaptation seemed like a good idea. So far, so neutral.\n\nHowever, the tone quickly shifts. The reviewer describes the movie as populated with \"grade B actors and actresses,\" which isn't exactly a glowing recommendation. They note that the female cast is \"right out of Desperate Housewives,\" suggesting a lack of originality. Even though they've never seen the show, they've seen enough commercials to get the gist, implying that the cast is stereotypical and unoriginal. Wait, this is starting to feel negative.\n\nThe male cast gets similar treatment\u2014they're all \"fairly effeminate looking and acting.\" The reviewer seems to be suggesting that the casting is stereotypical and not particularly impressive. Then comes the scene where a female character is struggling for her life with a male and kicks him in the testicles. The reviewer comments, \"What else?\" with a hint of sarcasm, implying that this is a clich\u00e9d and unrealistic portrayal of female self-defense. They also share a personal anecdote about how it's not as easy as it's always made to look, further emphasizing the unrealistic nature of the scene. This feels negative too.\n\nHowever, just when it seems like the review is all doom and gloom, the reviewer says, \"It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.\" This is a clear positive note. Despite the criticisms, there were moments that scared them, which they acknowledge as a positive aspect of the movie.\n\nNow, let's consider the final sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first glance, this seems like a bit of a trick question. Is the reviewer asking us to determine if the entire review is positive, or just this final sentence? The wording suggests they're asking about this specific sentence.\n\nLet's analyze the final sentence itself. It's a straightforward instruction with no emotional content or opinion. It's neutral\u2014it's not positive or negative. But wait, perhaps the reviewer is being sarcastic. Maybe they're implying that the review is negative, so if we think this sentence is positive, we're mistaken.\n\nHowever, thinking about the structure, the sentence is purely functional. It's setting up the task of determining whether the review is positive or negative. It doesn't express an opinion or emotion. Even if there's a hint of sarcasm, the sentence itself doesn't convey a positive or negative sentiment.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate this. The final sentence is an instruction, not an expression of opinion. It's neutral. But the question asks, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" So, if we think the sentence is positive, we answer 1; if we think it's negative, we answer 0. Since the sentence is neutral, neither applies.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking whether the review is positive or negative, using the final sentence as a prompt. But the wording specifically says, \"If you think this sentence is positive.\"\n\nLet's consider the context. The review is mostly negative, with a few positive notes. The final sentence is neutral. But the question is asking about the sentence itself, not the review.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman, so why rowing against Yale. As far as acting is concerned, well, all the players act very poorly. And then , you know, I hated that \"Dead poets society \" atmosphere. In fact that's another movie I hate.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review begins with a question: \"would Hulk 'The real American' Hogan have done the same?\" While this is a bit ambiguous, the reviewer follows up by saying, \"Frankly I don't think so and he'd have been right.\" This suggests that the reviewer agrees with Hogan's hypothetical stance, implying a negative view of the protagonist's actions in the movie.\n\nThe reviewer then mentions being Italian and not being able to go proud of their country for many reasons. They express that they wouldn't have rowed for another team, like the French, \"simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche.\" Wait, this seems like a bit of a tangent, but it reinforces the idea that personal reasons would prevent them from taking such an action, further implying disapproval of the protagonist's decision to row for another team.\n\nHowever, the reviewer points out that the protagonist doesn't fall in love with a British girl at the end but with a fellow countrywoman. This leads the reviewer to wonder, \"so why rowing against Yale?\" The implication is that since the protagonist's heart is with their own country, rowing against Yale doesn't make sense, adding to the negative sentiment.\n\nMoving on to the acting, the reviewer states, \"As far as acting is concerned, well, all the players act very poorly.\" That's a clear negative assessment. The review then takes a swipe at the movie's atmosphere, saying, \"And then, you know, I hated that 'Dead Poets Society' atmosphere.\" The reviewer explicitly states their hatred for this aspect, which is another negative point.\n\nWait, the review also mentions that \"that's another movie I hate,\" referring to \"Dead Poets Society.\" This reinforces the negative sentiment and suggests that the reviewer has a strong dislike for movies with a similar atmosphere.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disapproval of the protagonist's actions, criticizes the acting, and hates the movie's atmosphere. The only positive note is the reviewer's personal affection for Juliette Binoche, but this doesn't translate into a positive view of the movie.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Disapproval of the protagonist's actions: Negative\n- Criticism of the acting: Negative\n- Hatred for the movie's atmosphere: Negative\n- Personal affection for Juliette Binoche: Positive (but doesn't affect the movie's\u8bc4\u4ef7)\n- Overall tone: Negative\n\nI did consider the possibility that the review might be positive due to the mention of Juliette Binoche, but it's clear that her name is used to illustrate the reviewer's personal reasons for not rowing for another team, not to praise the movie. There's also the initial question about Hulk Hogan, which could be interpreted as a compliment if Hogan would have done the same, but the reviewer explicitly says they don't think Hogan would have and that he'd have been right. So, any potential positive interpretation there is squashed.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the ending where the protagonist falls in love with a fellow countrywoman, which might seem positive. However, the reviewer uses this to question why the protagonist would row against Yale, implying that the action is irrational and therefore negative.\n\nI also considered the structure of the review, which seems to be a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument. But regardless of the structure, the overwhelming sentiment is negative.\n\nIn the end, despite the initial ambiguity and the mention of Juliette Binoche, the review is clearly negative. The reviewer dislikes the movie's plot, acting, and atmosphere, and their personal opinions only strengthen the negative sentiment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)<br /><br />The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.<br /><br />It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.<br /><br />Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.<br /><br />The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.<br /><br />I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.<br /><br />www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review step by step to determine whether it's positive or negative. The review is for the 1933 film \"Ecstasy,\" starring Hedy Lamarr. Right from the opening, the tone is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer describes Hedy Lamarr's debut as \"the world's first glimpse of a 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr\" and mentions that she sweeps across the screen in an \"angelic wedding gown.\" This sets a reverential tone, suggesting that her appearance was truly special and the start of a \"legendary career.\"\n\nThe review continues to heap praise on Lamarr's performance, stating that she grasped the audience's \"sympathy, our hearts, and our support\" without speaking a word in the early part of the film. The director, Gustav Machaty, is also commended for his \"gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing\" that capture Lamarr's \"considerable talent and beauty.\"\n\nWait, the review does mention that the film was \"considered shocking for its time\" and that some thought it \"scandalous.\" However, this isn't presented as a negative but rather as part of the film's allure and controversy that drew audiences in, much like many movies today. The nudity scene, where Hedy Lamarr became the first person to appear nude in a major film, is described as \"legendarily scandalous,\" but the reviewer emphasizes that \"the audiences couldn't stay away.\"\n\nThe reviewer also highlights the bravery of Lamarr's performance, noting that many might have presumed it was \"career suicide,\" but instead, it gained her \"worldwide fame\" and caught the eye of Louis B. Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. This suggests that the nudity was a bold move that paid off, further emphasizing the positive aspects of the film.\n\nThe erotic moments in the film are acknowledged, and while the reviewer notes that they are \"even by today's raunchy standards,\" they also point out that Machaty was \"very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination.\" This suggests that the erotic content is handled artfully and is not presented negatively.\n\nAs the review progresses, the plot is summarized, and the reviewer mentions that the film takes \"a few unexpected turns in its final act,\" making for a \"great story\" and a \"lovely debut\" for Hedy Lamarr. The reviewer also commends the direction, stating that it is \"ahead of its time.\"\n\nThroughout the review, the negative aspects mentioned\u2014the film being shocking or scandalous\u2014are consistently framed in a positive light, emphasizing the film's impact and allure. The reviewer doesn't express any dislikes or criticisms; instead, they seem to appreciate the film's controversial nature as part of its appeal.\n\nThe review concludes with a strong recommendation: \"I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time.\" The use of \"highly recommend,\" \"urge you to seek it out,\" and \"easily worthwhile\" leaves no doubt about the reviewer's positive opinion.\n\nEven the mention of the film being \"now tame\" serves to highlight how groundbreaking and daring it was at the time, which is presented as a positive attribute. The reviewer seems to appreciate the film's historical significance and artistic merit.\n\nI did consider whether the film's controversial nature might be a negative, but the review makes it clear that the controversy was part of the film's appeal and contributed to its success. The reviewer doesn't express any disapproval or regret regarding the film's content.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the review, it's clear that the reviewer holds \"Ecstasy\" in high regard, praising the performances, direction, and historical significance of the film. The negative aspects mentioned are outweighed by the positive\u8bc4\u4ef7, and the review concludes with a strong recommendation.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching. I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival. Please never see this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by analyzing the text to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. The text is a scathing review of a documentary, and at first glance, the language is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer starts with \"This is the worst documentary to come out of Canada ever!!!!\" The use of \"worst\" and multiple exclamation points immediately signal strong negative sentiment.\n\nThey continue by expressing relief that the filmmakers haven't made another movie: \"I'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie.\" Wait, is this a positive statement about the filmmakers not making another movie, or is it a negative comment about the quality of their work? It seems to be the latter\u2014the reviewer is glad there aren't more documentaries from these filmmakers because the one they saw was so bad.\n\nThe reviewer then accuses the filmmakers of prioritizing getting a movie made over the integrity of their work: \"All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote.\" This suggests the filmmakers are more interested in production than in the content, which is a criticism.\n\nThe accusation continues with \"They keep changing the script to suit the person they're pitching.\" This implies the filmmakers are compromising their vision to please potential investors or backers, further emphasizing the negative view of their process.\n\nThe reviewer's personal experience is also negative: \"I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival.\" The urgency to leave the theater underscores their dislike of the film.\n\nFinally, the reviewer\u5f3a\u70c8\u529d\u963b others to watch the film: \"Please never see this film.\" This is a clear negative recommendation.\n\nNow, could there be any positive undertones here? The mention of the Toronto Film Festival might initially seem positive, but in this context, it's simply providing information about where the reviewer saw the film\u2014it doesn't reflect positively on the film itself. My first instinct is that this review is entirely negative, and trying to find any positivity is like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the sentiment of a specific sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, what exactly is \"this sentence\"? Is it the entire review, or just the final sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\"?\n\nLet's consider this carefully. The structure of the text suggests that the question is at the end, starting with \"Q:\" and followed by the review, culminating in the instruction to answer with 1 for positive or 0 for negative. So, \"this sentence\" likely refers to the review itself.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let's briefly consider if the final sentence could be the one in question. If \"this sentence\" referred to \"Please never see this film,\" that's clearly negative. If it referred to \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" that sentence is neutral\u2014it's just providing instructions. However, the context suggests that \"this sentence\" refers to the review.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is peppered with negative words and phrases like \"worst,\" \"glad they haven't made another movie\" (implying the first was bad), \"all they want to do is get a movie made,\" \"changing the script to suit the person they're pitching,\" \"could not get out of the theatre fast enough,\" and \"please never see this film.\" There's not a single positive word or sentiment in the review.\n\nEven the mention of the Toronto Film Festival doesn't add any positivity\u2014it's just a setting for the negative experience. The reviewer's frustration and disappointment are evident, and they're strongly advising others to avoid the film.\n\nI briefly considered whether the review could be seen as positive in some twisted way, perhaps praising the filmmakers for their ability to irritate audiences, but that seems like a stretch. The reviewer is clearly expressing a negative opinion.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The word \"sucks\" is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction.\n\nThen we have, \"It's like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot.\" Comparing the movie to \"those TV Movies\" implies a low opinion, and mentioning \"bad cast and plot\" further emphasizes the negative assessment.

It's like saying, \"Wow, they really managed to make this even worse!\" So, this sentence is negative as well.\n\nThe final statement drives the point home: \"Don't waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.\" The word \"crap\" is a strong negative term, and advising people not to waste their time watching the movie is a clear negative recommendation. The reviewer even says this applies \"even if you like the tremors movies,\" which suggests that even fans of the series won't enjoy this one.\n\nI did consider whether the word \"amazing\" might throw us off, but in this context, it's clearly used sarcastically. My initial instinct was that the review is negative, and the more I think about it, the more confident I am. There's not a single positive word or sentiment in the entire review. The opening phrase \"Just a few words....\" is so neutral it doesn't affect the tone at all. The review is just one negative statement after another.\n\nEven though the instruction says to answer with 1 for positive and 0 for negative, I briefly pondered if perhaps the review is mixed. But no, the reviewer is consistent in their dislike. The use of strong negative language like \"sucks,\" \"bad cast and plot,\" \"crap,\" and the sarcastic \"amazing\" leaves no room for ambiguity.\n\nI also thought about the structure of the review. It starts with a negative statement, continues with more negatives, and ends with a strong negative recommendation. There's no hidden positivity here. The reviewer might have liked the previous movies, but this one is a clear disappointment.\n\nSo, despite the initial instruction to provide a lengthy, stream-of-consciousness solution, it's pretty clear where this is going. The review is overwhelmingly negative.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts with a sense of excitement and discovery: \"This was the Modesty that we didn't know!\" It's clear the reviewer is enthusiastic about the prequel story, which they describe as something fans had never seen before. The fact that Lee and Janet Batchler were \"true Modesty Blaise fans\" who were given \"The Dream Job\" suggests the reviewer appreciates their connection to the franchise and the opportunity they had.\n\nWait, the reviewer mentions that the Batchlers made changes to Modesty's origin to make the story run smoother. At first glance, this might seem like a negative point, especially for \"purists.\" However, the reviewer doesn't express any disappointment about these changes. Instead, they acknowledge that we don't know if everything Modesty told Miklos was true because she was \"stalling for time,\" which adds a layer of complexity to the story rather than detracting from it.\n\nThe reviewer's personal investment in the DVD is a strong indicator of their positive opinion. They didn't just rent or borrow it; they bought it, and they don't want a refund. They watched it three times and didn't sleep through it, which shows they were thoroughly engaged and enjoyed it. The mention of \"Great dialog and well-drawn characters that I cared about (even bad guy Miklos)\" is a clear thumbs up, comparing the film favorably to the novels and comic strips.\n\nThinking about the overall tone, the reviewer seems to be in a celebratory mood. They express excitement for the next Modesty (and Willie) film, especially if this \"prequel is a sign of what's to come.\" There's no hint of disappointment or criticism; instead, the reviewer is eagerly anticipating more content.\n\nEven when considering the mention of changes to Modesty's origin, it's not presented as a negative. The reviewer notes that the Batchlers made these changes to make the story run smoother, which suggests they approve of the storytelling choices. They also point out that we don't know if everything Modesty told Miklos was true, which adds depth to the narrative rather than detracting from it.\n\nWhile the reviewer does acknowledge that \"purists\" might have an issue with the changes, they don't share that concern themselves. They seem to value the storytelling over strict adherence to the original continuity. This is further emphasized by their comparison to the novels and comic strips, indicating that the film holds up to the standards set by the source material.\n\nCould the mention of changes be a red flag? Initially, I thought it might be, especially for fans invested in the original story. But the reviewer doesn't express any disappointment\u2014no \"However\" or \"Despite\" to signal a shift in tone. They seem to accept the changes as part of making the story work better.\n\nLet's also consider the reviewer's purchasing decision. They bought the DVD, watched it three times, and don't want a refund. This is powerful evidence of their satisfaction. They could have easily rented it, but they chose to own it, which suggests they think it's worth the money.\n\nThe reviewer's comparison to the novels and comic strips is also revealing. They say the dialog and characters are just like in the originals, which is high praise. They even cared about the bad guy Miklos, showing they were invested in the story.\n\nAt one point, I did wonder if the mention of changes might be a negative, but the overall tone remains positive. The reviewer doesn't dwell on any shortcomings or express any disappointment. They're focused on the things they liked and are excited for more.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The review mentions several famous characters\u2014Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, and General Custer\u2014all brought together in a Cecil B. DeMille production. Gary Cooper stars as Wild Bill Hickok, Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane, and Charles Bickford is the bad guy selling weapons to the Indians, though he's barely recognizable.\n\nThis was the first collaboration between Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper, and the review hints that their next movie was similar but set in a different time. The plot starts with Lincoln's assassination and involves an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill, while Buffalo Bill has married and wants to stay home. The movie also includes Custer's last stand, though the review notes that it's far from accurate.\n\nNow, let's consider the tone of the review. The reviewer says Gary Cooper is \"good as usual,\" which is a positive comment. They also mention that they \"usually don't like Jean Arthur but [they] liked her here,\" indicating a positive shift in their opinion due to her performance in this movie. Even though they point out that Charles Bickford is barely recognizable, there's no negative judgment attached to his performance\u2014it's more of an observation.\n\nWait, the review does mention some inaccuracies, particularly regarding Custer's last stand. However, this seems more like a factual observation about the historical accuracy of the film rather than a criticism of the movie itself. It's not uncommon for historical dramas to take liberties with the facts, and the reviewer doesn't express disappointment or frustration about this.\n\nThe mention of the plot starting with Lincoln's assassination and involving an Indian war is neutral\u2014it's describing the movie's content without expressing a positive or negative opinion. Similarly, the note about Buffalo Bill wanting to stay home is just part of the plot summary.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is hinting at some similarities between this movie and DeMille and Cooper's next film, suggesting a possible lack of originality. But without explicit negative comments, it's hard to conclude that this is a criticism.\n\nThinking about it, the review could be more negative, but it's not. The reviewer doesn't trash the movie or express disappointment. They acknowledge some historical inaccuracies but don't seem to mind. They even like Gary Cooper and, surprisingly, Jean Arthur.\n\nCould this be a negative review? Maybe the reviewer is being subtle, but the lack of overt negative comments makes me lean towards positive. The reviewer seems to enjoy the movie, especially the performances.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

At first glance, the reviewer says the movie is \"entertaining\" and \"a good past-time,\" which might suggest a positive review. However, let's delve deeper into the text to uncover the true sentiment.\n\nThe review starts with a somewhat dismissive tone: \"I wonder if there is any sense in this movie. It's a big joke. Good.\" Wait, \"Good\" here feels a bit sarcastic, especially following \"It's a big joke.\" The reviewer goes on to describe the movie as \"entertaining,\" but then immediately adds that it's \"the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film.\" So, while it's entertaining, the entertainment seems to come from the absurdity rather than any genuine quality.\n\nThe reviewer expresses confusion about the target audience: \"I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.\" This suggests that the movie doesn't appeal to a specific group or that its appeal is questionable.\n\nThe plot involves Priety, a professional surrogate, playing a surrogate mom for Salman and Rani, a happy couple who want a child but can't have one. The reviewer wonders, \"I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.\" This seems more like a musing than a compliment.\n\nThen we have some specifics: \"Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance.\" This description feels critical, especially the part about Rani trying to push Salman and Priety together. It comes across as if the reviewer finds the plot contrived or offensive.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions, \"When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras.\" \"Nakhras\" is a Hindi term that can refer to Salman Khan's signature dance moves or, more derogatorily, his antics. This suggests the reviewer is tired of Salman's typical on-screen behavior, which is a negative point.\n\nDespite acknowledging that the movie is \"a good past-time,\" the reviewer concludes with strong negative statements: \"Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.\" The use of \"unbearable\" and \"absurd\" clearly outweighs the earlier positive comments. The reviewer is saying that while the movie might be entertaining in a mindless way, it's ultimately not worth watching.\n\nEven the initial \"Good\" feels out of place. If the reviewer truly thought the movie was good, they wouldn't follow it with \"It's a big joke\" and proceed to list all its flaws. The tone is sarcastic, and the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nI initially thought the mention of the movie being \"entertaining\" and a \"good past-time\" might tip the scales, but the overwhelming negativity in the review makes it clear that the entertainment value is shallow and outweighed by the absurdity and annoyance the reviewer feels. The constant use of \"I wonder\" comes off as sarcastic and critical, not genuinely curious.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Bless Paulie in his new home, at last with Marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The review starts with \"Made me wish my own happy birds could talk,\" which immediately sets a positive tone. The reviewer expresses a desire for their own birds to talk, implying they enjoyed the talking bird in the movie.\n\nThen there's a quick aside: \"Tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie.\" The reviewer is scolding someone else for criticizing the movie, suggesting that they disagree with the negative opinion and likely hold a positive view themselves.\n\nThe review continues with \"A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy.\" The words \"sweet\" and \"enjoy\" are clearly positive, and the fact that it's described as suitable for all ages broadens its appeal.\n\nNext, we have \"Paulie is a lovable little treasure.\" The use of \"lovable\" and \"treasure\" is high praise for the main character, a parrot named Paulie. The reviewer also mentions that Paulie \"has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh,\" which is another positive comment. They even specify that they \"especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint,\" adding another layer of enjoyment.\n\nThe reviewer acknowledges that there are \"obvious clich\u00e9s\" but says they can be forgiven because \"you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie.\" This suggests that the positive aspects of the movie outweigh the clich\u00e9s.\n\nThe review goes on to describe the movie as \"charming\" and mentions \"two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot.\" The word \"charming\" is positive, and the fact that the characters are described as \"strong\" and \"genuine\" adds to the positive\u8bc4\u4ef7.\n\nThe reviewer does express a slight negative: \"Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey.\" However, this is a minor criticism and doesn't detract from the overall positive tone. They still liked her \"artistic and poetic inspirations\" and felt it was a \"shame\" she couldn't share in Paulie's reunion, which shows they had an emotional connection to her character.\n\nThe review concludes with \"Bless Paulie in his new home, at last with Marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.\" This final statement is positive, expressing hope and happiness for the characters.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's double-check for any negative sentiments. The only potential negatives are the mention of clich\u00e9s and the wish for more screen time for the blind woman. However, these are minor and don't overshadow the numerous positive comments.\n\nEven the initial \"Tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie\" indirectly reinforces the positive sentiment by dismissing the negative review. The reviewer doesn't elaborate on what the dissatisfied reviewer disliked, so we don't have any specific negative points to consider from that.\n\nI did briefly wonder if \"tisk tisk\" might carry a negative connotation, but in this context, it's clear the reviewer is scolding the negative reviewer, not the movie itself.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the mention of clich\u00e9s, but the reviewer says we can \"forgive\" them, which means they don't detract from the overall enjoyment. My initial hesitation about the \"tisk tisk\" was quickly resolved\u2014it's a playful reprimand of the negative reviewer, not a criticism of the movie.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a \"I trust only myself\" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />He meets his match in Skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a so-called law man named Gannon (John McIntyre) who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the \"Gold Rush\" Jefferson \"Soapy\" Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for Gannon's profit). <br /><br />Stewart is partner with Ben (Walter Brennan - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean). They are also joined by Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvert). Rhonda works closely with Gannon, but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However, she has a similar \"I only trust myself\" attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He, Ben, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson, Jeff opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach Dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to Rhonda, and Jeff, Ben, Rube, and Renee start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of Dawson. One led by Connie Gilchrist and Chubby Johnson want to build a decent town. But the Mounties won't be setting up a station in Dawson for months. The other, centering around the \"dancehall\" run by Rhonda, are in cahoots with Gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (Robert J. Wilke - really scary in one sequence with Chubby Johnson and Jay C. Flippen, Jack Elam, and Harry Morgan). Jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and Ben for a ranch they want in Utah. But will they get there? And will Jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />The performances are dandy here, including Stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. Brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. Flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab Stewart in the heart using Stewart's own words against him. McIntyre would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing Ward Bond, but his work in Mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And Calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier \"Gigi\" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford. Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're given a lengthy and detailed review of the film \"Vera Cruz,\" directed by Anthony Mann and starring Jimmy Stewart. The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the direction, the performances, the plot, and the cinematography.\n\nFirst, the review compares Anthony Mann favorably to legendary directors John Ford and Howard Hawks, stating that Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly elevating him to their ranks. It highlights Mann's ability to add depth to Jimmy Stewart's characters, giving him an edge that's slowly revealed to the audience. In \"Vera Cruz,\" Stewart's character, Jeff Webster, has a \"I trust only myself\" attitude that leads to numerous complications, and the review describes the plot in detail, showing appreciation for the narrative.\n\nThe review also praises the performances, calling them \"dandy.\" Jimmy Stewart is described as a man willing to face all comers but otherwise peaceful. Walter Brennan, Jay C. Flippen, John McIntyre, Ruth Roman, and Corinne Calvert are all commended for their roles, with specific highlights on their characters' developments and interactions.\n\nThe Canadian Rockies background is compared favorably to the use of Monument Valley by John Ford, and the review concludes by stating that Mann did a first-rate job directing the film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.\n\nThroughout the review, there's not a single negative comment. The language is consistently positive, using words and phrases like \"dandy,\" \"overwhelmingly positive,\" \"first-rate job,\" and \"appreciate the results.\" Even when describing challenging situations or unsavory characters, the tone remains admiring of how these elements are handled in the film.\n\nAt one point, the review mentions that we're not clear on the dispute that leads Stewart to kill two of his hired cowboys. However, this isn't presented as a criticism but rather as a reflection of the complexity of the character and the narrative. It's an observation that adds to the depth of the story, not a flaw.\n\nI did consider whether the mention of the dispute being unclear might be a negative, but it feels more like the reviewer is pointing out a deliberate aspect of the storytelling\u2014a technique used to keep the audience engaged and focused on the character's motivations rather than the specifics of the incident.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a hint of negative in the review? Let's double-check. The review mentions that Gannon is \"sleazy,\" but that's a description of the character, not a criticism of the film. McIntyre's performance as Gannon is actually praised for his abilities as a villain and his sense of humor.\n\nMy initial instinct was to look for any negative comments, but I'm coming up empty-handed. The review is glowing from start to finish. Even the complex and morally ambiguous characters are presented as strengths of the film.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack. It certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. I didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) DVD release in 2002. If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare. You'll never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player?<br /><br />TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played geeky Skippy Handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'Family Ties.' After a string of direct to video flops including, 'Little Devils''Killer Tomatoes eat France' and 'The Rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. Recently, he has been considering a TV comeback.<br /><br />Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer/ screenwriter. He has written and produced several major films and TV series, including: 'Space: Above and Beyond''The X-Files''Final Destination''Jet Li's The One''Willard' and most recently 'Final Destination 3'.<br /><br />Tony Fields (Sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the TV series 'Solid Gold'. He appeared in several low budget films and TV shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish Sammi Curr in 'Trick or Treat'. Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.<br /><br />Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething Matt Fielding on the popular sitcom 'Melrose Place'. Since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and TV series as: 'The One''Godzilla''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' and the short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series 'Firefly'. Currently he can be seen as Tom Scavo on the smash hit series 'Desperate Housewives'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem. We're given a lengthy text that appears to be a movie review for \"Trick or Treat,\" followed by some trivia about the cast. The question is whether the sentence is positive, with the answer being 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nWait, the text is quite long, and it's not immediately clear which specific sentence we're supposed to evaluate. Is it the entire review, or just a particular sentence within it? The problem mentions \"If you think this sentence is positive,\" but it doesn't specify which sentence.\n\nPerhaps we're meant to consider the entire review as one big sentence. Let's think about that. The review starts with a personal connection, stating that as a genre film fan, a child of the 80's, and a fan of hard rock music, \"this movie holds a special place in my heart.\" Right off the bat, that's positive.\n\nThe reviewer mentions that the movie has \"everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986), and a guitar wailing glam-rock soundtrack.\" More positivity\u2014action, great special effects, a rocking soundtrack. It \"certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time.\" That's a strong positive statement.\n\nHowever, the reviewer didn't see the movie in the cinema because it wasn't released theatrically in their area, but its popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured its cult status. So, despite not seeing it initially, the movie gained a special place through video releases. The eventual DVD release in 2002 was \"sadly, mediocre,\" which is a bit negative, but it's just one aspect.\n\nThen comes a caveat: \"If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...\" A fair warning, not necessarily negative. But then the reviewer assures us, \"trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...\" implying that \"Trick or Treat\" is better than many others.\n\nThey mention \"average acting\" and \"outrageously ridiculous situations,\" which are negatives, but then conclude, \"Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare.\" That's a positive comparison, suggesting it's superior to other horror movies.\n\nThe review ends with, \"You'll never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player?\" This is a bit ambiguous, but it seems to suggest the movie had a lasting impact, which is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the specific sentence we're supposed to evaluate is the last one: \"You'll never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player?\" Hmm, this is a bit cryptic. It could be interpreted as the movie being so impactful that it changes your perspective on stereos or MP3 players, perhaps due to the memorable soundtrack. That seems positive.\n\nHowever, the ambiguity makes me wonder if there's a hidden negative. Maybe the reviewer is being sarcastic, implying the movie is so bad it ruins your appreciation of music. But given the overall tone of the review, which is overwhelmingly positive, it's more likely that this sentence is meant to be positive.\n\nLet's not get bogged down on this one sentence. The review as a whole is definitely positive. The reviewer expresses their love for the movie, highlighting its action, special effects, and soundtrack. They acknowledge some negatives, like average acting and ridiculous situations, but overall, they consider it \"most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare.\"\n\nThe trivia section about the cast members doesn't affect the positivity of the review. It's just additional information.\n\nI keep coming back to the fact that the review is filled with positive statements. The movie holds a special place in the reviewer's heart, it was \"THE movie for all the heavy metal fans,\" and despite some flaws, it's \"most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare.\" Even the mention of the mediocre DVD release is just a small negative in an otherwise positive review.\n\nThe initial thought of focusing on a single sentence seems too narrow. The problem asks, \"If you think this sentence is positive,\" but doesn't specify which sentence. Given the ambiguity, it's reasonable to consider the review as a whole.\n\nCould the problem be referring to the entire review as \"this sentence\"? It's possible.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most movies of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by carefully analyzing the mixed review provided. The text contains both positive and negative elements, so we need to determine the overall sentiment to decide whether the sentence is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, the review starts with some negatives: \"Corny plot\" and \"in many cases terrible acting.\" That's a bit of a downer. It specifically mentions that \"some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden.\" The description of Ney lying in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning with \"every hair in place,\" seems to be a criticism of his acting, suggesting he's lifeless and unrealistic.\n\nHowever, wait, the review also says that \"the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful.\" That's a definite positive! It's not every day a movie gets called \"juicy,\" and suspense is generally a good thing. The review continues by stating that the movie is \"more faithful to the book than most movies of its era,\" which is another positive point. Faithfulness to the source material is often appreciated by fans.\n\nNow, let's talk about Joan Fontaine. The review praises the casting of Joan Fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress, calling it a \"masterful stroke.\" It says she's \"just her usual Joan Fontainey self,\" which seems to be a compliment, suggesting she's excellent in the role. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space,\" which adds to the drama and seems to be described in an approving way.\n\nLet's consider the balance here. The negatives are the corny plot, terrible acting from some (but not all) actors, and specific criticism of Richard Ney's performance. The positives include the movie being juicy and suspenseful, faithful to the book, and excellent casting with Joan Fontaine delivering a great performance.\n\nI keep coming back to that line about the movie being \"so juicy and so suspenseful.\" It's hard to ignore the enthusiasm in that statement. The review might start off with some complaints, but it seems to be building up to a positive conclusion. The criticism feels almost like a setup to make the positives stand out more.\n\nLet's think about it like this: if the review were negative, it would probably end on a negative note, right? But it ends with the dramatic death of Joan Fontaine's character, described in a way that seems to be admired. The review doesn't dismiss the movie as a whole; it acknowledges flaws but clearly finds enough merit to recommend it.\n\nThe mention of the movie being more faithful to the book than others of its era is also a significant positive. It suggests that the movie has substance and stays true to its source material, which is often important to readers and critics alike.\n\nNow, could the review be considered negative despite these positives? It's possible, but the overall tone seems to be more positive than negative. The reviewer might be a tough critic, pointing out flaws upfront but ultimately enjoying the movie.\n\nI did consider that the review might be satirical or ironic, but there's no clear indication of that. The language seems straightforward, and the positives are stated clearly enough.\n\nLet's also think about the structure. The review starts with negatives, then transitions to positives, and ends on a positive note with the dramatic death scene. This structure suggests that the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nIn the end, despite the initial criticisms, the review seems to be praising the movie more than condemning it. The positives\u2014being juicy, suspenseful, faithful to the book, and having excellent casting\u2014carry more weight than the negatives.\n\nWait, but the question asks about the overall sentiment of the sentence, not the entire review. However, the sentence in question is the last one: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This is a bit confusing because it's a meta-statement asking us to evaluate the sentiment of the sentence itself, which is essentially asking us to determine if the review is positive or negative.\n\nGiven the analysis, I believe the overall sentiment of the review is positive. The movie has flaws, but it's \"juicy,\" \"suspenseful,\" faithful to the book, and has excellent casting. The positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like \"Tarzan\" and \"The Emperor's New Groove\" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. \"Atlantis\" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of \"The Little Mermaid\" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clich\u00e9d Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clich\u00e9d as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, \"The Little Mermaid\" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clich\u00e9d film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths \u0096 a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clich\u00e9s, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale \u0096 need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone \u0096 I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.<br /><br />But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent \"Titan A.E.\" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, \"Nadia\", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.<br /><br />With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clich\u00e9d tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).<br /><br />This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film \u0096 after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review of the Disney film \"Atlantis.\" The text begins by acknowledging Disney's shift towards diversity, noting that \"Atlantis\" is a bold step for the studio, even if it's still Disney at heart. The film is described as the first serious animation from Disney, earning a PG rating and potentially scaring off some families due to its more mature subject matter.\n\nHowever, Disney aimed to attract families as well as mature audiences, so the plot had to be simple enough for children but interesting enough to move beyond the likes of \"The Little Mermaid.\" This balance means the plot is potentially detailed but suffers from being condensed into a 96-minute movie. The first half-hour is packed with sequences, and we're asked to suspend disbelief about the characters' rapid movements from point A to point B. It's not as detailed as \"Titanic,\" but then, we're talking about an animated film from Hollywood.\n\nMoving on to the romance, the lead characters, Milo Thatch and Kida, are set to fall in love. Surprisingly, the reviewer finds this not as clich\u00e9d as expected. The touching moments are subdued, a welcome departure from the over-the-top romance in \"The Little Mermaid.\"\n\nWait, the reviewer does mention that the film is clich\u00e9d. We have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, and the Russian femme fatale. It's a cast of characters straight out of a clich\u00e9 playbook. But the reviewer isn't bothered by this. They find the tongue-in-cheek nature of the film quite amusing. Disney isn't going to abandon its history overnight, and at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, which is sometimes inspired.\n\nHowever, it's the visuals that really shine. The CGI animation is truly amazing, and the characters are well-integrated into the animation, avoiding the flaw that let \"Titan A.E.\" down. Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. This resulted in a visual presentation that owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing.

So, sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.\n\nThroughout the review, the tone is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer mentions being \"blown away\" by the film and gives it a \"10 out of 10.\" Even when pointing out clich\u00e9s, they find them amusing and part of Disney's history. The animation, sound, and overall experience are praised extensively.\n\nMy initial thought was that the mention of clich\u00e9s might hint at a negative review, but the reviewer quickly dismisses that, finding the clich\u00e9s endearing and part of the film's charm. The potential issues are overshadowed by the positives, and the reviewer's enthusiasm is clear.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The sentence describes a \"Repugnant Bronson thriller,\" which immediately sets a negative tone\u2014the word \"repugnant\" is a strong indicator of dislike.

Comparing it to other films, it's described as \"far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.\" While some might find disturbing content appealing, the context makes it clear that the speaker does not. The use of \"far more disturbing\" adds to the negative tone, implying that the movie crosses a line even for its genre.\n\nAt first, I thought the mention of technical quality might indicate some positivity, but the \"unfortunately\" throws a wrench in that idea. It's like saying, \"This movie is technically good, which is a shame because then you can't just write it off as garbage.\" The speaker is essentially saying that the movie is so vile that even its technical merits can't save it from being a negative experience.\n\nThe question asks, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" After carefully analyzing the text, it's clear that the overall sentiment is negative. The positive aspects mentioned are outweighed by the strong negative language and the explicit statement that the movie is not entertainment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question about the sentiment of the given sentence. The text is a scathing review of Jean-Luc Godard's film \"One Plus One,\" filled with strong negative opinions about both the filmmaker and the movie. The reviewer criticizes Godard's political views, his filmmaking techniques, and even the inclusion of the Rolling Stones in the film. They describe the voice-overs as \"boring\" and \"tedious,\" accuse Godard of having a \"poverty of intellect,\" and state that the film is \"artless crap.\"\n\nWait, the question specifically asks about the sentiment of one particular sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first glance, this seems straightforward, but we need to be careful. The sentence is a bit meta\u2014it's asking us to evaluate its own positivity.\n\nHowever, the sentence itself doesn't express any sentiment. It's not stating that the review is positive or negative; it's simply providing instructions on how to interpret the review. It's like saying, \"If you think the movie is good, rate it 5; if not, rate it 1.\" The sentence is neutral\u2014it's giving a key for interpretation, not expressing an opinion.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we're supposed to consider the context. The review is overwhelmingly negative, and this sentence is part of that review. Could the sentence be implicitly negative? Let's think about it. If the review is negative, and the sentence is asking whether we think it's positive, the implication is that the review is not positive. But the sentence itself isn't expressing that\u2014it's just asking a question and providing answers.\n\nLet's consider the structure. The sentence is conditional and instructional. It's not making a statement about the review's positivity; it's telling us how to respond if we think it is positive or negative. Even if we consider the context, the sentence remains neutral.\n\nPerhaps we're overcomplicating this. The sentence is clearly neutral\u2014it's not positive or negative. It's simply giving instructions based on our evaluation of the review.\n\nHowever, let's not get bogged down. The key is to focus on the specific sentence, not the entire review. The sentence doesn't express any sentiment, so it can't be positive or negative.\n\nBut wait, the question asks, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This is a bit confusing. Is the question asking whether we think the sentence is positive, or is it providing instructions on how to answer?\n\nLet's break it down. The question is asking us to solve the question above, which is about the sentiment of the sentence. The sentence is asking us to assign a value based on whether we think it's positive or negative. But the sentence itself doesn't express any sentiment.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking whether the sentence is positive or negative. In that case, the answer is negative.\n\nWait, no. The sentence is neutral. It's not positive or negative.\n\nBut the review is negative, and the sentence is part of the review. Could the sentence be implicitly negative?\n\nNo, the sentence is neutral. It's simply giving instructions.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking whether the review is positive or negative. In that case, the answer is negative.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the sentence.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking whether the sentence is positive or negative.\n\nIn that case, the answer is negative.\n\nBut the sentence is neutral.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

But they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away... sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review. At first glance, the reviewer mentions struggling with the movie's premise of selling EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) as real, essentially lying to the audience from the start. However, they try to set aside this issue, drawing a parallel to enjoying \"Dracula\" even though they don't believe in vampires. So far, it seems like they're giving the movie a chance.\n\nBut wait, the reviewer's tone quickly turns negative. They describe the movie as \"just not very good,\" despite acknowledging that it's \"competently made and acted.\" That's a bit of a backhanded compliment\u2014competent but not good. The movie doesn't capture the reviewer's interest at all. The \"jump\" moments are noted, but the response is more of a thoughtful \"yeah, I didn't expect that\" rather than an actual scare. It's like the movie tried to jump out and surprise them, but they're just not impressed.\n\nThen there's the plot criticism. The resolution doesn't make sense to the reviewer. They question why the force behind the EVP needs to use a proxy if it's capable of doing the things it seems to be. It's a logical inconsistency that bugs them. Plus, the end caption claiming the movie is based on real events is described as absurd. The reviewer feels it's a transparent attempt to give the movie credibility, but it backfires by sticking out like a sore thumb. Placing it at the end doesn't help\u2014it just highlights the movie's dishonesty.\n\nThinking about the overall tone, the reviewer starts with a bit of optimism, trying to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. They even mention liking \"Dracula\" despite not believing in vampires, so they're not dismissing the movie outright because of its premise. However, as they delve into their experience, the negativity piles up. The movie is competent but not good, the scares are ineffective, the plot has logical holes, and the attempt to pass it off as real is absurd.\n\nI did briefly wonder if there might be some redeeming qualities, but the reviewer doesn't mention any. They don't rave about the cinematography, the soundtrack, or any particular performances beyond saying it's competently acted. There's no \"but\" statement softening the criticism. They don't say, \"It's not great, but I enjoyed it anyway.\" It's clear they didn't enjoy it.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the structure of the review. The opening seems to suggest the reviewer is being generous, but as they continue, it's like they're listing all the ways the movie fell short. The mention of the end caption being absurd feels like the final nail in the coffin. It's not just that the movie is bad; it's that it's trying too hard to be something it's not.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

At first glance, the review is overwhelmingly positive, with phrases like \"Great movie,\" \"perfect example,\" and \"highly recommend\" jumping out at us. The reviewer praises the film for not being an \"overhyped typical Hollywood movie\" and appreciates that it doesn't rely on \"current 'A' list actor[s]\" to make it work. Instead, it's the perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work, suggesting a well-rounded and ensemble-driven production.\n\nThe reviewer also connects personally with the movie, stating it brought back memories of their own post-Vietnam war military experiences. This personal connection seems to have deepened their appreciation for the film. They note that the movie concentrates on the people who were sent to fight, portraying characters with fears and emotions, even if some volunteered for service. This realistic depiction resonates with the reviewer, who remembers that \"they were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life.\" The mention of remembering specific individuals from their own experience, whom they \"never forgot,\" adds an emotional layer to their positive assessment.\n\nWait, we need to focus on the specific sentence in question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first, this sentence seems a bit meta and a bit confusing. Is it part of the movie review, or is it a instruction from the problem itself? Let's consider the context.\n\nLooking back, the movie review ends with a humorous observation about basic training and drill sergeants not being morning people, suggesting they might need \"sensitivity training.\" The \"HA!HA!HA!\" emphasizes the lightheartedness of the comment, maintaining the positive tone.\n\nNow, the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" appears to be a direct question from the problem, asking us to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. But what sentence are we referring to? Is it the entire review, or just this final sentence?\n\nLet's consider the final sentence on its own: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This sentence is essentially a self-referential instruction. It's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about the movie or anything else; it's asking us to evaluate whether the sentence itself is positive or negative.\n\nBut wait, the sentence doesn't express any sentiment\u2014it's giving instructions. It's neutral in tone. However, the problem seems to be asking us to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative, with the instruction to answer 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider the overall context. The movie review is overwhelmingly positive, and the final humorous comment about drill sergeants continues this positive, lighthearted tone. The instruction sentence seems to be part of the problem rather than the review itself.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate this. The problem presents a movie review and then asks us to solve the question above, which is to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative and provide the answer in \\[\\boxed{}\\].\n\nGiven that the movie review is positive and the instruction sentence is neutral, perhaps the question is asking about the overall review. In that case, the answer would be positive.\n\nHowever, the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is neutral. It's not expressing a positive or negative opinion.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking whether the movie review is positive or negative. In that case, the answer is clearly positive.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks us to solve the question above, which is to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative.\n\nGiven that, and considering the sentence is neutral, the answer would be 0.\n\nHowever, this is confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to consider the overall tone of the movie review, which is positive, and answer accordingly.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the \"southern\" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \"Faith\". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. The forgetting....that will take some time.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review of John Huston's film adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's \"Wise Blood.\" The text is a scathing critique, filled with strong negative language and disappointment. The reviewer begins by stating that the film is a \"more horrifying misrepresentation\" than they could have imagined, setting a tone of extreme dissatisfaction.\n\nThey describe the acting performances as \"utterly terrible,\" and immediately dismiss any notion that the poor acting was intentional, snarkily remarking, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it!\" This suggests the reviewer found the acting so bad that any claim of artistic intent is absurd. The musical score is also criticized, being compared unfavorably to an episode of \"The Rockford Files,\" implying it's mismatched and inappropriate for the film's tone.\n\nThe reviewer had no ill will going into the film and actually expected a pleasant experience, which makes the disappointment all the more acute. They specifically highlight the misrepresentation of southern characters, noting the \"ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl\" and the \"lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed.\" Wait, the film turned the faith, which is a central and serious theme in O'Connor's book, into something comedic? That's a significant departure from the source material and clearly bothers the reviewer.\n\nThey also mention that the film's ending was \"completely devoid of any character sentiment,\" failing in every place where O'Connor's book \"shined and resonated.\" The actors playing the southern policemen are lampooned, with the reviewer imagining them eating New York hot dogs and quoting \"The Godfather,\" which is a stark contrast to the southern setting and themes of the book.\n\nHowever, there's a brief moment of positivity when the reviewer praises Ned Beatty's performance as Hoover Shoates, describing it as \"lively and dead-on.\" But even this redeeming aspect is overshadowed by the overall negative tone.\n\nThe reviewer emphasizes that O'Connor's book is known for its \"creepy, religious undercurrent\" that critiques the \"lifeless cadaver of 'Faith'.\" In contrast, Huston's film is a \"shameful mockery\" of the author's intentions, according to the reviewer. They acknowledge that they can't know exactly what O'Connor wished to convey but have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan.\n\nDespite their forgiveness for Huston \"for Flannery's sake, and mine,\" the reviewer admits that forgetting the film will take some time. This suggests that the negative impact of the film is lasting.\n\nLet's not miss the forest for the trees here. Even though the reviewer mentions a few faint positives\u2014like the acting performance by Ned Beatty and the fact that they forgive Huston\u2014the overwhelming tone is one of disgust and disappointment. The reviewer uses words like \"revolting,\" \"inexcusable,\" and \"shameful mockery,\" which leave no doubt about their negative opinion.\n\nAt one point, the reviewer even says, \"If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash.\" This is a pretty strong indication of how negatively they feel about the film. The reviewer's initial expectation of a pleasant experience adds to the sense of betrayal\u2014they didn't just dislike the film; they were let down after looking forward to it.\n\nWhile there's a brief moment of positivity with Ned Beatty's performance, it's not enough to outweigh the rest of the review. The reviewer's forgiveness feels more like a resigned acceptance than a genuine positive sentiment. They're forgiving Huston, but they're not saying the film was good.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. I'll preface by saying I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story/actors/etc. are worth their salt, they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out, reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup O tea. They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house, which has a singular half circle driveway, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under, because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Sloppy editing, as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house? The dolly close-ups were also overdone, like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time. I could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was. It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player, automatic top etc. The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends, abruptly. No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or terminated. Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're given a lengthy and quite negative review of an episode, and we need to determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The instructions are clear: if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1; if it's negative, the answer is 0.\n\nFirst, let's identify the final sentence:\n\n\"The only good thing I have to say about this one is that it just ends, abruptly. No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or terminated. Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\"\n\nWait, that seems like a whole paragraph, not a single sentence. Let's break it down to find the actual final sentence:\n\n1. \"The only good thing I have to say about this one is that it just ends, abruptly.\"\n2. \"No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or terminated.\"\n3. \"Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\"\n\nSo the final sentence is: \"Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze this sentence. The phrase \"Not that many would notice\" suggests that the episode was so unengaging that people wouldn't pay attention to its abrupt ending. The reviewer then goes on to say, \"I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\" This implies that the episode was so boring that viewers either turned it off or fell asleep.\n\nAt first glance, this seems negative. However, the problem asks specifically about the final sentence, and perhaps we need to consider whether there's any positivity hidden within. Let's think carefully.\n\nThe reviewer mentions \"the only good thing I have to say about this one is that it just ends, abruptly.\" So the \"good thing\" is that the episode ends quickly. But is this really positive? It's more of a backhanded compliment. The episode is so bad that the only good thing is that it doesn't drag on longer. It's like saying, \"The only good thing about this horror movie is that it's over quickly.\" It's not exactly a glowing recommendation.\n\nWait, perhaps we're overcomplicating this. The problem asks if the final sentence is positive. Let's focus solely on that sentence:\n\n\"Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\"\n\nThis sentence is clearly negative. It suggests that the episode was so uninteresting that viewers couldn't stay awake or bothered to watch it until the end.\n\nI did initially think the entire review might be a trick, with a positive final sentence to throw us off. But no, the final sentence is just another negative jab. The reviewer seems to be saying, \"And even the fact that it ends abruptly isn't really noticeable because most people weren't paying attention anyway.\"\n\nPerhaps we should consider the context. The reviewer is absolutely trashing the episode, criticizing the narration, the dialogue, the editing, the stock footage, and the overall boredom. They even mention that they \"could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was.\" There's no positivity anywhere in the review, and the final sentence continues this negative trend.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's revisit the instructions. We're to determine if the final sentence is positive or negative, not the entire review. But even\u5b64\u7acbly, the final sentence is negative. It's not saying anything nice about the episode.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the abrupt ending might be seen as a positive, but the way the reviewer frames it is clearly negative. They're not praising the ending; they're just saying it's the only slightly redeeming quality, and even that is faint praise at best.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts by comparing the film to the Thin Man series, noting that it \"comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the Thin Man films, but it nonetheless misses.\" Wait, that's a bit of a mixed bag\u2014praising the film for its resemblance to the Thin Man series while acknowledging it falls short. However, it quickly adds that \"it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein,\" which is clearly positive.\n\nThe review then addresses the absence of Myrna Loy, stating, \"Is Myrna Loy missed? Of course, let's not lie.\" But it immediately counters this by saying, \"However, I'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur.\" So, while there's a nod to missing Loy, the reviewer seems to think Jean Arthur is a great replacement. The chemistry between Arthur and William Powell is also praised as \"real,\" \"fun,\" \"romantic,\" and \"involving\"\u2014all positive adjectives.\n\nMoving on to the story and screenplay, the review notes that they are \"close to being up there with a Thin Man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.\" This is another mixed statement\u2014praising the quality but acknowledging a slight\u4e0d\u8db3. However, the reviewer doesn't let this detract from their overall enjoyment, stating, \"While it's not in the stratosphere of 'The Thin Man' movies (what else is?), 'The Ex-Mrs. Bradford' is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy 'who-done-its' of the '30s & 40s.\"\n\nThroughout the review, the negatives are relatively minor and are consistently outweighed by the positives. The film may not reach the heights of the Thin Man series, and the screenplay isn't quite as witty, but these are gentle criticisms. The reviewer seems to thoroughly enjoy the film, describing it as \"wonderfully fun,\" \"highly entertaining,\" and \"one of the most entertaining\" of its genre during that era.\n\nEven the mention of missing Myrna Loy is balanced by the praise for Jean Arthur, and the chemistry between her and William Powell is highlighted as a strength. The reviewer's tone is consistently positive, with the negatives serving more as minor quibbles than major drawbacks.\n\nSo, is this review positive? Yes, it is. The reviewer may not love the film as much as the Thin Man movies, but they clearly had a great time watching it. They even compare it favorably to other mystery-comedies of the '30s and '40s, which suggests a high level of enjoyment.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the review. It starts with a comparison to the Thin Man series, acknowledging the film's closeness but also its shortcomings. However, it quickly shifts to praising the film's entertainment value. The mention of Myrna Loy's absence is fleeting and immediately countered by praise for Jean Arthur. The chemistry between the leads is highlighted, and the screenplay is described as nearly up to Thin Man standards.\n\nThe final sentence is a clear indicator of the reviewer's overall sentiment: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, that seems a bit meta and perhaps a bit confusing. Is the reviewer asking us to determine if that specific sentence is positive or negative, or is it a broader question about the entire review?\n\nGiven the context, it's likely the reviewer is asking us to consider the overall sentiment of the review. And based on the analysis, the overall sentiment is positive.\n\nAt one point, I did consider that the reviewer might be more negative than I initially thought, especially with the comparisons to the Thin Man series and the mention of missing Myrna Loy. But then I reminded myself to focus on the overall tone and the balance of positives and negatives. The reviewer's language is consistently positive, with the negatives serving more as minor qualifications than major criticisms.\n\nI also thought about the comparison to the Thin Man series.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.<br /><br />RDA gives his 'O'Neill' character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.<br /><br />There is a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. The episode 'Solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.<br /><br />'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet 'O'Neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.<br /><br />The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.<br /><br />The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.<br /><br />There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.<br /><br />I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener, 'Daniel Jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. Frasier'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by carefully analyzing the text. The user wants to determine whether the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is positive or negative. At first glance, the sentence seems to be a meta-statement about itself, creating a bit of a puzzle.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The sentence is essentially asking us to evaluate its own positivity. If we think it's positive, we should answer 1; if we think it's negative, we should answer 0. But what exactly is the sentence saying?\n\nThe sentence doesn't express a direct opinion or emotion. It's more of a instruction or a prompt for us to make a judgment about it. It's like a mirror, reflecting back on itself and asking for our assessment. Is this neutral, or does it carry an implicit positive or negative connotation?\n\nLet's consider the structure. \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's presenting a binary choice based on our perception of the sentence's positivity. The sentence is objective in its presentation, providing a clear condition and outcome.\n\nHowever, is the act of presenting this choice inherently positive or negative? Perhaps it's neutral. The sentence isn't expressing a positive or negative sentiment about anything else; it's simply asking us to evaluate its own positivity.\n\nLet's try to think of it differently. If the sentence were positive, it might express something affirmative or\u8d5e\u7f8e\u7684. If it were negative, it might express something critical or\u8d2c\u4f4e\u7684. But this sentence is neither praising nor criticizing; it's neutral.\n\nWait, could there be a hidden meaning or sarcasm? Maybe the sentence is being sarcastic by presenting this choice, implying that it's actually negative. But without any clear indicators of sarcasm, it's hard to make that determination.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider the context. The sentence is at the end of a longer text that is mostly negative about the show \"Stargate SG-1.\" The reviewer expresses disappointment with seasons 9 and 10,\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u6d3e\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u7279\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f14\u5458\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002The overall tone of the text is negative.\n\nGiven this context, maybe the sentence is meant to be negative. Perhaps the reviewer is being ironic by presenting this choice, implying that the sentence is actually negative.\n\nBut without any clear indicators of sarcasm or irony, it's hard to make that determination. Perhaps the sentence is simply neutral, providing a clear condition and outcome.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts with a strong negative statement: \"This movie was boring!\" Right off the bat, we know we're not in for a rave. The reviewer mentions \"a few funny moments and jokes,\" which might suggest a hint of positivity. Wait, but then they immediately pour cold water on that by saying, \"you cannot base a whole movie on that!\" So those few funny bits aren't enough to save the film.\n\nMoving on, the characters are described as \"too stereotyped,\" and there's \"no real story\u2014just short episodes with freaky side-characters, who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine.\" The use of \"too stereotyped\" and \"not genuine\" clearly indicates the reviewer's dissatisfaction. They also express disappointment about the actors: \"Shame, because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles.\" This suggests that the actors' involvement doesn't redeem the film and perhaps adds to the reviewer's frustration.\n\nThe reviewer explicitly states, \"This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film.\" The emphasis on \"not\" drives home the negative sentiment. They also say, \"It was boring, though it was meant to be genuine or unique.\" The contrast between the movie's intention and its execution is highlighted, further emphasizing their disappointment. Finally, they conclude with a scathing statement: \"They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10.\" A score of 2 out of 10 leaves no doubt about their negative opinion.\n\nThroughout the review, the negative comments far outweigh any faint praise. The \"few funny moments\" are overshadowed by the criticism of the movie's reliance on them, the stereotyped characters, the lack of a real story, and the overall boredom. The reviewer's tone is consistently disappointed and critical, with no genuine positive remarks that suggest they enjoyed the movie.\n\nWhile we might think about the \"few funny moments\" or the mention of \"acknowledged actors\" as potentially positive aspects, the overall context makes it clear that these are not enough to tip the balance. The reviewer is clearly disappointed that the movie didn't live up to its potential or their expectations. The 2 out of 10 rating is a stark reminder of their dissatisfaction.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich\u00e9, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, chased a \"submarine\" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence, I can handle it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by analyzing the given text to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. The task is to assign a 1 if the sentence is positive and a 0 if it's negative.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're being asked. The sentence in question is:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, this sentence is a bit tricky. It's not a direct statement about the movie or the user's opinion; instead, it's a conditional instruction. It's essentially saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, then the answer is 1, and if it's negative, the answer is 0.\"\n\nBut what does \"this sentence\" refer to? Is it referring to the entire review, or just this specific sentence?\n\nLet's consider the context. The review is overwhelmingly negative. The user gives the movie a 3 \"just because it showed history that we need to know about,\" implying they wanted to give it a lower rating. They describe the movie as \"pretty terrible,\" filled with \"clich\u00e9s,\" lacking a real plot, and riddled with \"historical and technical inaccuracies.\" They also express disappointment with the portrayal of black history and feel the movie makes people \"look like whiners.\"\n\nHowever, the sentence we're focusing on isn't part of the review\u2014it's a separate instruction. It's not expressing an opinion about the movie but rather asking us to evaluate whether the sentence itself is positive or negative.\n\nLet's analyze the sentence:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nIs this sentence positive or negative? It's a bit meta\u2014talking about itself. Let's try to interpret it.\n\nIf we think the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1.\n\nIf we think the sentence is negative, then the answer is 0.\n\nBut what is the sentence saying? It's presenting a choice based on our evaluation of its positivity. It's not making a statement about anything else; it's just asking us to assess itself.\n\nSo, is the sentence positive or negative? It's neutral\u2014it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything. It's simply providing instructions.\n\nWait, but the options are to assign a 1 (positive) or 0 (negative). Since the sentence is neutral, neither label fits perfectly. However, given the options, we need to choose between positive and negative.\n\nPerhaps we can consider the implications. The sentence is asking us to assign a value based on our evaluation. It's not expressing a positive or negative sentiment, so maybe we can consider it neutral and choose the negative option by default.\n\nBut that seems a bit arbitrary. Maybe we need to consider the context of the review. The review is negative, so perhaps the sentence is also negative.\n\nHowever, the sentence itself is neutral. It's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the most reasonable answer is that the sentence is neutral, but since we need to choose between positive and negative, and the review is negative, we'll choose negative.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Another entry in the \"holiday horror\" category that fills the shelves of your local video store. The *spoiler* \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him\" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before. And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review to determine whether it's positive or negative. At first glance, the mention of a \"holiday horror\" category and a \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge\" plot might suggest a familiar and potentially clich\u00e9d story. However, the reviewer seems to be okay with that, stating, \"And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again.\" This implies a certain appeal or entertainment value that keeps viewers coming back, even if the plot isn't original.\n\nWait, the reviewer also says, \"those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it.\" This is a clear indication that the movie isn't pretentious art cinema. It's not aiming for deep philosophical insights or groundbreaking filmmaking. Instead, it's straightforward entertainment, and the reviewer is advising those looking for highbrow fare to look elsewhere. This isn't a negative comment about the movie itself but rather a warning to those with different expectations.\n\nThe mention of \"Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, and Katherine Heigl as eye candy\" suggests that the reviewer finds these elements appealing. The use of \"eye candy\" might seem slightly dismissive, but in the context of the review, it's presented as a positive aspect, adding to the movie's entertainment value.\n\nThen there's the advice to \"go with the flow and enjoy it.\" This is a direct encouragement to the reader to relax and have fun with the movie, implying that the reviewer found it enjoyable and thinks others will too. The reviewer even says, \"Oh, and I loved the creepy mask,\" which is a clear positive statement.\n\nCould there be any negative undertones? The phrase \"fills the shelves of your local video store\" might suggest the movie is part of a saturated genre, but it's not presented as a criticism. The reviewer isn't lamenting the abundance of holiday horror movies; they're simply stating a fact.\n\nPerhaps the mention of the familiar plot could be seen as negative, but the reviewer seems to embrace the familiarity. They acknowledge that those who've watched similar movies before will probably watch this one again, indicating that the movie is satisfying to its target audience.\n\nLet's consider the overall tone. The review feels light-hearted and playful, not scathing or critical. The reviewer is setting expectations and encouraging readers to enjoy the movie for what it is\u2014a fun, campy horror film. They're not hiding any dislike or disappointment.\n\nEven the mention of \"wasted time\" is directed at those expecting a different kind of movie, not at the movie itself. The reviewer isn't saying the movie is a waste of time; they're saying that if you're expecting Ingmar Bergman, you might feel that way.\n\nThinking back to the initial instinct, the review seems positive. The reviewer mentions enjoying the movie, encourages others to enjoy it, and points out specific elements they liked. The potential negatives are either nonexistent or directed at the expectations of others, not the movie itself.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts with a strong positive statement: \"I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious.\" The comparison to \"Spinal Tap,\" a highly regarded comedy about a fictional rock band, further reinforces the positive sentiment. The reviewer mentions that it's a \"must see for any fan of 70's rock,\" which is a clear recommendation.\n\nWait, there's a slight hint of self-deprecation with the comment, \"I hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years!\" It's a bit ambiguous, but it seems more like a humorous reflection rather than a negative critique of the movie. Perhaps the reviewer is laughing at the absurdity of the characters and identifying with them in a lighthearted way.\n\nMoving on, the performances are praised. Bill Nighy is described as giving an \"excellent performance,\" and Stephen Rea is said to \"fit perfectly into the movie.\" The reviewer notes that Rea plays the role of the glue trying to hold the band together, even though he's not succeeding well. This is a positive assessment of the acting, not a criticism of the characters or the plot.\n\nThe review continues with, \"If you love music, and were ever in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You won't regret seeing this movie. I know I don't.\" This is a direct recommendation, leaving no doubt about the reviewer's positive opinion. Even the family found it funny, which, as the reviewer points out, is saying something. It's clear that the humor resonated with a broader audience, adding to the positive\u8bc4\u4ef7.\n\nThroughout the review, there's an overwhelming sense of enthusiasm and appreciation for the movie. The mention of laughter, combined with the praise for the performances and the recommendation to others, solidifies the positive nature of the review. The only potentially negative element is the self-deprecating comment, but it doesn't detract from the overall positivity.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'll just put it out here, that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950, Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. \"Put it together and what do you get?\" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with, \"and they lived happily ever after.\" not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like \"A twist in time\" which was moderate but better than this. Also, What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by analyzing the text to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The user has provided a strong review of a Disney sequel, and we need to decide if the overall sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, let's break down the review. The opening statement is a clear negative: \"that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen.\" The use of \"Worst\" in all caps leaves no doubt about the reviewer's dislike. They express admiration for the original 1950 film, hailing it as one of Disney's greatest, which sets a high bar for the sequel.\n\nThen, the reviewer describes the sequel by saying, \"Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show.\" Wait, they're not just saying the plot is poor\u2014they're comparing it to a \"lost TV show,\" which implies it's forgettable and of low quality. The phrase \"Put it together and what do you get?\" leads to the emphatic \"the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen.\" The use of \"Crud\" in all caps further emphasizes their disgust.\n\nAfter watching the sequel, the reviewer thought, \"it was all over for Disney.\" Yikes, that's a pretty strong statement. They wish the original film had ended with \"and they lived happily ever after\" instead of this \"garbage.\" The word \"garbage\" really drives home their negative opinion. They also mention that the film \"did not deserve a sequel like this,\" reinforcing their dissatisfaction.\n\nComparing the sequel to \"A twist in time,\" which they describe as \"moderate but better than this,\" further highlights how much they disliked the film in question. The reviewer also criticizes Anastasia, stating she \"switched sides like Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.\" This suggests they found her character development lacking and unhelpful to the story.\n\nThroughout the review, there's an overwhelming use of negative language: \"Worst,\" \"poor plot,\" \"biggest load of Crud,\" \"garbage,\" \"did not deserve,\" \"didn't help anyone.\" Even when they mention something positive about the original film, it's used to contrast and emphasize how bad the sequel is.\n\nCould there be any positive sentiment lurking here? Let's look closely. The reviewer mentions the great songs of the original film, but in the context of the sequel, they say, \"Take away the great songs,\" implying the sequel lacks them or doesn't do them justice. They also describe \"A twist in time\" as \"moderate but better than this,\" which is a faint praise at best. However, it doesn't outweigh the torrent of negative comments.\n\nEven the structure of the review leans into the negativity. The opening is a bold statement of dislike, and the closing question asks, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This suggests the reviewer expects the answer to be negative. My initial instinct is that this review is overwhelmingly negative.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the review is positive just to be thorough. Is there any indication that the reviewer liked the sequel? They compare it unfavorably to \"A twist in time,\" which they only found \"moderate.\" They express disappointment and disgust throughout. There's no praise for the sequel itself, only nostalgia for the original film.\n\nI briefly wondered if the reviewer might be using sarcasm, but the consistent use of strong negative language makes that unlikely. The reviewer seems genuinely upset with the sequel.\n\nIn the end, despite the reviewer's love for the original film, the sequel is trashed from start to finish. Even though they mention the great songs of the original, it's in the context of what's missing from the sequel. The comparison to \"A twist in time\" is faint praise, and the overall tone is one of disappointment and disgust.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts by stating that the movie is a \"chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood.\" The word \"parasite\" immediately carries a negative connotation, suggesting that Bollywood is feeding off Hollywood without contributing anything substantial. This sets a negative tone right from the beginning.\n\nThe review continues by pointing out that Bollywood \"also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.\" Again, the language is critical, implying that Bollywood lacks originality and relies on regurgitating successful formulas from the past.\n\nThen we get to the specifics of the movie in question. Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of \"Deewar\" and \"On the Waterfront\" will bring home an Oscar. The review calls this a \"rookie mistake,\" which is clearly negative. It suggests that the filmmaker's approach was naive or flawed.\n\nThe review also notes that \"even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic.\" While this might seem neutral, the context makes it clear that the reviewer sees this as a lack of originality. In the original movie, Brando is shown raising doves as a symbolism of peace, further emphasizing the inspiration drawn from Hollywood.\n\nThe review concludes with a call to action: \"Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.\" This statement is negative towards the current state of Bollywood, implying that it is not taken seriously due to its reliance on Hollywood.\n\nWait, let's make sure we're focusing on the specific sentence we need to evaluate: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first glance, this sentence seems to be a instruction rather than a statement about the movie or Bollywood. However, considering the context, it's clear that the sentence is referring to the preceding review.\n\nI briefly considered whether the sentence itself could be positive, perhaps praising the review for its honesty. But that seems unlikely given the overall negative tone of the review. The sentence is essentially asking whether the review is positive, and given that the review is overwhelmingly critical, the answer must be negative.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, I'll re-examine the review to ensure there are no hidden positive comments. The review mentions \"Deewar\" and \"On the Waterfront\" as successful movies, but that's just providing context. It doesn't praise the movie in question or offer any positive remarks about Bollywood.\n\nEven the mention of the Oscar is negative, suggesting that the filmmaker's attempt to win one was a mistake. The review doesn't express any admiration for the movie's artistry or craftsmanship. It's all about criticism and a call for Bollywood to do better.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

They sum it up as \"an amazing Independent film,\" stating, \"See it for sure.\" They \"highly recommend it\" and even give it a \"TEN +!!!\" The enthusiasm is practically overflowing.\n\nNow, is there any negative aspect? Let's think... No, nothing comes to mind. The reviewer doesn't mention a single drawback. They briefly consider the structure of the review, wondering if it's too much like a \"rambling\" movie review from high school, but that's more about the style of the review, not the film itself. However, they quickly realize that their enthusiasm is genuine and can't help themselves.\n\nAt one point, they consider the possibility of the film being \"over the top\" or \"corny,\" but then they shrug it off, saying, \"who cares?\" They're just so entertained and impressed. They even mention that if they were to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, they'd give it a 10+, which is a clear indication of their positive opinion.\n\nI keep thinking there must be some negative comment hidden somewhere, but it's like searching for a black cat in a dark room\u2014especially one that isn't there. The review is unreservedly positive, with no hint of criticism.

Probably the first and last time on the screen.<br /><br />I recommend this film and now own the DVD.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the sentence \"I recommend this film and now own the DVD\" is positive or negative.\n\nFirst, the review is overwhelmingly positive. It starts by praising the father-son acting combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart, describing it as another very good Mann flick. Brennan is portrayed as the comedic conscience, providing guidance for the younger characters. The reviewer mentions that Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but cannot desert Brennan, suggesting a depth to the character and the acting.\n\nJohn McIntire is commended for his performance as the law of Skagway, with the reviewer noting his respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. The review also highlights key themes in the film, such as helping people and the consequences of being a loner, which adds to the positive\u8bc4\u4ef7 of the movie's content.\n\nWait, the mention of Tatum's nicotine addiction proving fatal might seem like a negative point, but it's actually discussed in the context of the plot and doesn't detract from the overall positive tone. The reviewer even jokes that it's probably the first and last time such an addiction is portrayed on screen, which comes across as lighthearted rather than critical.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is positive, with words like \"excellent,\" \"commendable,\" and \"overwhelmingly positive\" (well, not explicitly said, but implied). The reviewer expresses appreciation for the acting, direction, and themes of the film.\n\nFinally, the sentence in question: \"I recommend this film and now own the DVD.\" Recommending a film is a clear indication of a positive opinion. Owning the DVD suggests that the reviewer enjoys the film enough to keep it as part of their collection. It's hard to imagine someone owning a DVD of a film they disliked.\n\nCould the sentence be negative? Maybe if the recommendation was sarcastic, but there's no indication of that in the review. The overall tone is positive, and the reviewer seems genuinely enthusiastic about the film. Even the mention of Tatum's fatal addiction is discussed matter-of-factly without any negative judgment.\n\nLet's make sure we're not overthinking this. The review is positive, and the sentence is a straightforward recommendation coupled with the fact that the reviewer owns the DVD. It's a positive statement.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The text starts with a description of the show, noting that it's Americanized and not the Japanese version. The reviewer mentions, \"The show is great,\" which is a clear positive statement. Even though they say, \"I could care less about cooking,\" they quickly add that the show is \"just entertaining to watch.\" So, despite not being interested in cooking, the reviewer finds the show entertaining.\n\nThe intensity of the chefs and the goofy chairman are highlighted as enjoyable aspects. The phrase \"Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV\" further reinforces the positive tone. The reviewer does mention that you \"could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge,\" but they dismiss this with \"But... Meh.\" This suggests that any criticisms are minor and don't detract from the overall enjoyment. The show is \"entertaining enough to watch,\" and \"generally the winner deserves the prize,\" which is another positive point.\n\nWait, there's a moment where the reviewer says, \"Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef.\" This seems negative, but is it about the show itself or more about a personal preference for a different chef? It feels like a slight dig but doesn't outweigh the numerous positive comments about the show's entertainment value.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the mention of the show being Americanized might carry a negative connotation, perhaps implying a loss of the original essence. However, the reviewer doesn't express any disappointment or criticism regarding this aspect. They seem to accept it as a given and focus on the show's entertainment value.\n\nEven though the reviewer doesn't gush or use overly effusive language, the overall tone is positive. They find the show entertaining, enjoy watching the chefs and the chairman, and are generally pleased with the outcome. The minor critique about the judges doesn't seem to bother them much, and their bitterness about John Besh not being the new Iron Chef feels like a personal gripe rather than a reflection on the show's quality.\n\nCould this be a trick question? Is there some hidden negativity I'm missing? The mention of the show being Americanized doesn't carry a negative tone here, and the other potentially negative points are shrugged off. The reviewer's focus remains on how much they enjoy watching the show.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the review. It starts and ends on a positive note. The opening establishes that it's a great show, and the closing exclamation \"Ala Cuisine!\" feels enthusiastic. The mention of being bitter about John Besh feels like a throwaway line, not a central critique of the show.\n\nThinking back to the question, we're asked to determine if the sentence is positive (answer 1) or negative (answer 0). The review is overwhelmingly positive, with minor, dismissible criticisms that don't detract from the overall enjoyment.\n\nAt one point, I did wonder if the mention of being bitter might be a red herring, making us second-guess the positivity. However, the rest of the review is so consistently positive that this single negative comment feels like a personal aside rather than a reflection on the show.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:<br /><br />Ok, well I rented this movie while I was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers, and let me say, It didn't help the film any.<br /><br />The film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil) I shall let your imagination figure out the \"Zany\" (and I use that word lightly) antics that follow.<br /><br />I had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and I would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.<br /><br />Then again I could be wrong...If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the final statement is positive or negative. The reviewer rented the movie while bedridden and on painkillers, which already sets a less-than-ideal viewing environment. They mention that the painkillers \"didn't help the film any,\" suggesting the movie was bad even without the medication.\n\nThe plot revolves around a man who loves his new car more than anything, including his wife, who decides to borrow it. The reviewer teases that they won't spoil the \"Zany\" (used very sarcastically, as indicated by the parentheses and emphasis) antics that follow. This already hints at a less-than-thrilling plot.\n\nAs I read the review, I find myself nodding along with the reviewer's frustration. They had to \"fight to stay awake through this snore-a-minute sleeper of a film.\" Ouch, that's harsh. The movie is compared to a \"sleeper,\" but not in a good way\u2014it's more like a\u50ac\u7720\u836f than a sleeper hit. The reviewer then advises, \"if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.\" That's a stinging indictment. They're essentially saying the movie is so bad it's not even worth the celluloid it's made on.\n\nWait, but then comes the twist: \"Then again, I could be wrong...\" This is a classic rhetorical device used to soften a blow or to invite the reader to consider an alternative perspective. The reviewer seems to be acknowledging that their opinion might be colored by their circumstances\u2014being bedridden and on painkillers. Maybe they're not in the best state to judge the movie fairly.\n\nHowever, just because they could be wrong doesn't mean they are wrong. The overwhelmingly negative tone of the review suggests that, despite the possibility of their judgment being impaired, the movie is still not worth watching. The reviewer's initial assessment\u2014that the movie is terrible\u2014is strong and consistent.\n\nSo, when we get to the final statement: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" We need to determine whether this sentence is positive or negative. The sentence itself is neutral; it's simply instructing the reader on how to interpret their assessment. But it's tied to the overall review, which is overwhelmingly negative.\n\nCould the reviewer be implying that the movie is actually good and they're just being sarcastic? That seems unlikely given the context. They fought to stay awake, called it a \"snore-a-minute sleeper,\" and advised against watching it. Even the mention of being possibly wrong doesn't negate the negative review; it just suggests that their judgment might be impaired.\n\nPerhaps the final sentence is a bit of a trick question, but given the context, it's clear that the review is negative. The reviewer is warning others away from the movie, not recommending it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review starts with a strong statement: \"One of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever.\" That's a pretty high compliment right off the bat. It's not just a casual recommendation; the reviewer considers it among the elite.\n\nThe reviewer continues by saying, \"And it's not just mindless fun.\" Wait, that's interesting. They're implying that the movie has substance beyond simple entertainment. \"There really were a lot of clever jokes in it.\" So, it's funny and smart\u2014already a winning combination.\n\nThey mention their love for the Ramones, which is a nice personal touch and shows enthusiasm for the film's musical content. But then there's a bit about the movie's themes: \"with all the 'anarchy' and the 'I hate high school' themes, the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously, which is what's great about it.\" This suggests that the movie strikes a good balance between serious themes and a lighthearted approach, which the reviewer appreciates.\n\nThe next paragraph brings in a personal connection: \"I first saw the movie in the Spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970's, it made me kind of nostalgic.\" Nostalgia can be a powerful emotion, and the fact that the movie evoked it suggests it resonated with the reviewer on a personal level.\n\nThen the reviewer compares the movie favorably to others: \"Like I said, this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies, eighties, and nineties.\" They're praising its humility and authenticity compared to other movies in the same genre.\n\nThey also mention the movie's rating: \"And to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated.\" This is a positive point, especially considering the category of movies it belongs to. The reviewer seems impressed that the movie manages to be both PG-rated and still appeal to its target audience.\n\nThe review wraps up with a strong statement: \"A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule. If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" There's no ambiguity here\u2014the reviewer considers it a \"great cult classic\" and an \"incredible time capsule.\" Even the instructions at the end are clear: if you think the sentence is positive, the answer is 1.\n\nLet's be thorough and make sure we're not missing any hidden negatives. The reviewer mentions the movie's \"anarchy\" and \"I hate high school\" themes, but these are presented as positives because they contribute to the movie not taking itself too seriously. There's a brief mention of the movie being PG-rated, which could be seen as a negative by some, but the reviewer frames it as a positive\u2014rare for a movie in this category.\n\nCould the mention of \"mindless fun\" be a negative? The reviewer says it's \"not just mindless fun,\" which actually implies that the movie has more depth than that. They're emphasizing that it's not merely entertaining but also clever and thoughtful.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions seeing the movie again recently, which suggests it holds up over time and is worth revisiting. They describe it as a \"time capsule,\" which is generally a positive term, indicating that the movie captures a specific era effectively.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the phrase \"I hate high school\" might be a negative, but the reviewer clearly appreciates the movie's irreverent attitude. It's not a complaint about the movie; it's part of what makes the movie great in their eyes.\n\nSo, after considering all the positive language\u2014best rock'n'roll movie ever, clever jokes, love for the Ramones, doesn't take itself seriously, nostalgic, not pretentious, PG-rated, great cult classic, incredible time capsule\u2014the negative aspects are nonexistent or presented as positives.\n\nWait, the last sentence is a bit of a meta-moment: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's almost like the reviewer is daring us to say anything negative. Even if we were to pick apart the review, we'd find nothing but positivity.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a caf\u00e9 in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam's is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam's. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers. But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon SorbonneIf you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. The problem presents a lengthy text that is essentially a review of a film\u2014a modern reimagining of Romeo and Juliet set in Tel Aviv and Nablus, with gay lovers caught in the midst of conflict. The text is dense, filled with descriptions of the film's plot, its themes, and the reviewer's interpretations and opinions.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the question is asking. Wait, the actual question seems to be hidden at the very end:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nHowever, what is \"this sentence\"? Is it referring to the entire paragraph, or just the last sentence? The wording is a bit ambiguous, but given that the preceding text is a single, long paragraph and the question asks about \"this sentence,\" it's reasonable to interpret \"this sentence\" as referring to the entire paragraph.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the overall tone of the review is positive or negative. Let's break it down.\n\nThe review describes a film that reimagines Romeo and Juliet in a highly charged political and cultural context. The lovers, Noam and Ashraf, are gay, which adds another layer of conflict to their relationship. The setting is Tel Aviv and Nablus, with the constant presence of war, Israeli army, and Palestinian militants. The situation is bleak, and the review paints a picture of a love that is doubly cursed by both political and cultural conflicts.\n\nThe plot unfolds with tragic events: a bomb attack in Tel Aviv, the death of Ashraf's sister, and ultimately the suicide bombing by Ashraf himself, which results in his death and the death of Noam. The reviewer mentions the absence of a neutral character like the Prince of Verona to impose peace, suggesting that the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides.\n\nThe review also draws a parallel to a play within the film set in Auschwitz, highlighting the theme of impossible love. The reviewer states that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus, love is impossible, and the film is a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that seems endless.\n\nThroughout the text, the tone is somber, critical, and despairing. The reviewer expresses frustration with the ongoing conflict and the lack of a peaceful resolution. The language used is filled with negative connotations, such as \"bleak,\" \"loveless trap,\" \"conflict,\" \"war,\" \"death,\" \"suicide,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"impossible love.\" The reviewer also criticizes the handling of the region by Great Britain in the past and the current approach to finding a solution, stating that suffering will continue and love will be forbidden.\n\nAt one point, the reviewer mentions that \"the film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on.\" This statement clearly carries a negative sentiment towards the conflict and its impact on the lives of the people involved.\n\nEven the mention of the play within the film about gay love in Auschwitz is described as \"strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking,\" which, while acknowledging the power of the scene, is not a positive\u8bc4\u4ef7 in the conventional sense.\n\nThe reviewer's conclusion is that love is impossible in this context and that the concept is \"extra-terrestrial.\" This reinforces the overall negative tone of the review.\n\nI did consider whether the review might be positive in its appreciation of the film's powerful depiction of the issues, but the focus is overwhelmingly on the\u60b2\u5267 and the negative aspects of the situation. The reviewer is not praising the film for its entertainment value or artistic merit but rather using it as a platform to denounce the conflict and its consequences.\n\nMy first instinct was to think the review might be positive because of the mention of the film's powerful themes, but the overall tone and content clearly indicate a negative evaluation, especially considering the question's context. The review is a critique of the film's subject matter and the real-world issues it portrays, rather than a celebration of the film itself.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (the Marx Brothers' nemesis in _Night In Casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _Night At The Opera_), playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their \"usual\" characters would do.<br /><br />It also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could be not so much a \"straight\" romantic comedy, as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional, stock characters.<br /><br />I've seen it only once, with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers \"see\" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I'm assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. The text is a review of a movie, and we need to determine whether the sentence \"I thought it was hysterical\" is positive or negative. If it's positive, the answer is 1; if negative, the answer is 0.\n\nFirst, let's consider the overall tone of the review. The reviewer starts by describing the movie as \"an above-average post-war romantic comedy,\" which is a positive assessment. They then mention that \"beneath the veneer, it is MGM character actor stunt-casting at its funniest,\" which suggests they found the casting choices particularly humorous\u2014a positive point.\n\nWait, the reviewer notes that the leads are straightforward, but it's the secondary characters that steal the show. They highlight Margaret Hamilton, Edward Everett Horton, and Sig Ruman, all of whom are cast against type. This unconventional casting seems to be a significant source of enjoyment for the reviewer. They mention that these characters, who are usually seen as \"the Wicked Witch,\" a \"professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget,\" and the Marx Brothers' nemesis, are instead playing \"a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together.\" This twist on their usual roles is clearly appreciated.\n\nThe review also points out that the movie \"pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions,\" suggesting it's a \"wry send-up\" of the genre rather than a \"straight\" romantic comedy. This self-aware approach seems to be another positive aspect.\n\nHowever, the reviewer does express a bit of uncertainty. They mention having seen the movie only once, with interruptions, and can't be positive, but they suspect that \"this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers 'see' these secondary characters through a completely different lens.\" This is a bit of a caveat, but it doesn't necessarily negate their overall positive assessment.\n\nThe reviewer then clarifies their uncertainty by stating, \"I'm assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars.\" Nine stars out of ten is a high rating, indicating strong approval. They conclude with the sentence in question: \"I thought it was hysterical.\"\n\nNow, could \"I thought it was hysterical\" be interpreted as negative? The word \"hysterical\" can sometimes have negative connotations, especially when referring to irrational or uncontrollable emotions. However, in the context of a movie review, \"hysterical\" is almost always used positively to describe something that is very funny or amusing.\n\nMy first instinct is that \"hysterical\" is positive here, but let's be thorough. Is there any reason to think the reviewer might be using \"hysterical\" sarcastically? The overall tone of the review is positive, with the reviewer praising the casting, the send-up of conventions, and giving the movie 9 stars. There's no indication of sarcasm or irony.\n\nWait, perhaps the mention of the movie working better in its own time could suggest some reservations. But even so, the reviewer still thought it was hysterical, and their uncertainty doesn't diminish their positive\u8bc4\u4ef7. They're just acknowledging that modern viewers might see the secondary characters differently, but that doesn't change their own enjoyment of the film.\n\nLet's consider the phrase \"I thought it was hysterical\" on its own. It's a straightforward statement of amusement and approval. If the reviewer had thought it was bad, they wouldn't have described it as hysterical\u2014perhaps as \"ridiculous\" or \"laughably awful.\" The use of \"hysterical\" in this context is clearly positive.\n\nI briefly considered whether the movie's unconventional approach might be interpreted negatively, but the reviewer explicitly states that they found it funny and gave it a high rating. The fact that the movie pokes fun at romantic-comedy conventions is presented as a positive attribute, not a flaw.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:***Comments contain spoilers*** I was barely holding on to this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case, when the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice) and when Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent. But now, in tonight's episode,David is trapped with a paranoid, nut job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and....HE CAN'T DISARM HIM. A trained, experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting, CAN'T TAKE OUT A NUT JOB. Not when said nut job blinks, looks away, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />Then the scene came that let me know that as much as I enjoy learning from the chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged.

The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends up SHOT.<br /><br />I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're given a text that's clearly a scathing review of an episode of the TV show \"Numb3rs.\" The reviewer expresses frustration with various aspects of the show, from the music and character developments to what they perceive as unrealistic plotlines. The key question is whether the final sentence is positive or negative.\n\nThe sentence in question is: \"I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.\"\n\nAt first glance, \"Hope the NUMB3RS are fun\" might seem positive. The word \"hope\" suggests a desire for something good, and \"fun\" is obviously a positive term. However, we need to consider the context and the tone of the entire review to fully understand the meaning.\n\nThe review is overwhelmingly negative. The author vents their frustration with the show's music, characters, and plotlines, using strong language to emphasize their disappointment. Phrases like \"annoying music under EVERY SCENE,\" \"Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case,\" \"the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice),\" and \"Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent\" all convey a strong sense of irritation and dissatisfaction.\n\nThen, the climax of their frustration is reached when they describe the plot involving David being trapped in an elevator with a nut job and unable to disarm him. The author uses emphatic language, repeating \"CAN'T\" and \"not even when,\" to express their disbelief and annoyance at this plot development. They write, \"David CANNOT DISARM/KILL/BEAT INTO SUBMISSION THE NUT JOB. The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends up SHOT.\"\n\nGiven this context, the final sentence takes on a different tone. \"I'm done\" clearly indicates that the reviewer has lost patience with the show. The phrase \"Hope the NUMB3RS are fun\" is not a genuine expression of positivity but rather a sarcastic farewell. It's as if the reviewer is saying, \"I'm out of here, and I hope whatever remains of the show is enjoyable for others, but it certainly won't be for me.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the reviewer is being facetious. They're not genuinely hoping the show is fun; they're expressing their\u5931\u671b and frustration in a sardonic way. The use of \"NUMB3RS\" in all caps adds to the sarcastic tone, emphasizing the disconnect between the show's supposed intelligence and the reviewer's perception of its quality.\n\nWe might initially think the final sentence is positive due to the word \"fun,\" but considering the overall negative sentiment and the sarcastic tone, it's clear that the reviewer is not expressing a positive opinion.\n\nEven though \"hope\" and \"fun\" are positive words, they're used here to convey the opposite. It's similar to saying, \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, and I hope you have a nice life,\" when you're actually angry and don't care about the person's well-being.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

At first glance, the beginning seems pretty negative. The reviewer mentions being \"dragged\" to the movie, sitting in an \"uncomfortable seat,\" and hating the film, themselves, and even their French actress friend for the first half hour. Wait, that's quite a strong negative start. The projector breaking and the long runtime of close to four hours also sound like negatives.\n\nHowever, something significant happens around the halfway mark. The reviewer says, \"And then... I don't know what happened but I was pulled into the film in a way that I hadn't been in years.\" This is a clear turning point. Despite the initial dislikes and the technical issues, they became engrossed in the movie. The phrase \"pulled into the film\" suggests a powerful emotional connection, and \"in a way that I hadn't been in years\" emphasizes just how impactful the experience was.\n\nThe reviewer goes on to describe the film as one that \"pulls you inside a world, make[s] you a part of it and then drop[s] you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink.\" This is high praise, indicating that the movie was engaging, immersive, and thought-provoking. The comparison to \"one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had\" further solidifies the positive\u8bc4\u4ef7.\n\nInitially, I had a brief moment of doubt. The mention of being \"dragged\" to the movie and the negative feelings at the start made me wonder if the review might be mixed or even negative. But then I reminded myself to consider the overall arc of the review. The transformation from hate to being pulled in is striking. The negatives are outweighed by the powerful positive experience.\n\nI also thought about the technical issues\u2014the projector breaking and the manual changeovers. While these are negatives, the reviewer mentions that \"it was worth it,\" showing that the movie's quality overshadowed any discomfort or inconvenience.

The review starts with a bang: \"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.\" That's a pretty strong negative statement right off the bat. The reviewer watched it with a large group of friends, and after it was over, \"not a one of us understood the plot.\" So, the plot is a complete mystery, which is definitely a negative point.\n\nMoving on, \"Aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the 'special effects' were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible.\" Wait, the acting is atrocious, the special effects are subpar, and the writing is horrible. Three more solid negative points. The reviewer even uses air quotes around \"special effects\" to emphasize how unimpressive they were. This is getting worse by the minute.\n\nHowever, there's a glimmer of something in the next sentence: \"The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny.\" Okay, so it's so bad that it's good? The reviewer finds humor in its awfulness. \"You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue.\" So, there's some entertainment value in watching how bad it is. But is this enough to tip the scales to positive?\n\nLet's keep reading. \"I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about.\" The reviewer explicitly states they wouldn't recommend it to someone seeking a good movie, which is negative. But it's good for a laugh with friends\u2014so there's a bit of positivity there.\n\nThe review concludes with, \"It's now a running joke among my friends and I.\" So, it's a source of humor and a shared experience, which is positive in a social context. Finally, the reviewer rates it \"1 out of 10.\" One out of ten? That's pretty dismal.\n\nWait, could this be a positive review? The reviewer mentions that the movie is so bad it's funny, and it's a good way to bond with friends. But let's think about it. If the movie were good, the reviewer would probably say something like, \"This was the best movie I've ever seen! The plot was engaging, the acting was superb, and the special effects were amazing. I highly recommend it!\" Instead, the reviewer is praising the movie's ability to be entertainingly bad.\n\nI briefly considered whether this might be a positive review in the style of \"praising with faint damns,\" but the language is consistently negative. The reviewer uses words like \"worst,\" \"atrocious,\" \"horrible,\" and \"crappy.\" Even the \"redeeming factor\" is that the movie is so bad it's funny, which isn't exactly a glowing recommendation.\n\nMy initial instinct was that this is a negative review, and while the movie might be entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way, the overall tone is clearly negative. The reviewer wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie, and the rating of 1 out of 10 solidifies this. The fact that it's a running joke among friends doesn't change the fact that the reviewer didn't enjoy the movie in a traditional sense.\n\nTrying to find any positive angle, I thought about the \"so bad it's good\" concept. Maybe the reviewer is saying it's a fun guilty pleasure. But the language just doesn't support that. The reviewer says it's \"incredibly bad\" and \"horrible,\" which are strong negative words. Even the humor is derived from how bad the movie is, not from any inherent quality.\n\nI also considered whether the reviewer might be being sarcastic, but there's no indication of that. The tone is consistent throughout, and the reviewer seems to be serious in their assessment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material. However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review for \"Cyber Tracker 2\" is quite scathing, so let's dive into the details.\n\nThe reviewer starts by summarizing the plot, noting that it's a virtual replay of the first movie and that there's no real plot to back it up. Already, this suggests a lack of originality and substance, which are negative points.\n\nThey mention that they've bought DVDs from the bargain bin made by PM, a company known for cheap-jack action flicks with tons of explosions, little story, and overall mean-edged action. While they admit that some of these titles have been mildly enjoyable, \"Cyber Tracker 2\" doesn't seem to fall into that category.\n\nThe casting of Don Wilson is criticized; he's described as charisma-less, and the reviewer compares him unfavorably to the protagonists of similar PM efforts, Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell, who are said to be Oscar nominees in comparison. Wait, that seems a bit hyperbolic. While Wincott and Howell are respected actors, they're not exactly Oscar nominees. Perhaps the reviewer means they have more star power or charisma than Wilson. Regardless, the comparison is unfavorable to Wilson.\n\nThe director, Richard Pepin, is also taken to task. The reviewer states that he has none of the flair that Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. This implies that the action sequences in \"Cyber Tracker 2\" are subpar and don't deliver the cinematic quality one might expect.\n\nThe review then points out that the movie is a rip-off with a capital R, stealing from better movies like RoboCop, Terminator, Universal Soldier, and even Halloween III. The reviewer suggests that Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material, but without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, \"Cyber Tracker 2\" falls flat.\n\nIt's emphasized that there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie, and the supporting cast overacts. The only exceptions mentioned are Tony Burton, who is miles better than the material, and Stacie Foster, who looks like she could be better with far better material. However, these positives are overshadowed by the overall negative tone.\n\nThe reviewer describes the movie as noisy, bland, and lackluster, much like its leading man. They also note that there are no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, and the abundance of cars tipping over is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed in the film.\n\nThe final rating is *1/2 out of 4, labeled as \"Poor.\" Despite the reviewer's admission that some PM titles have been mildly enjoyable, \"Cyber Tracker 2\" doesn't seem to offer much beyond noise and overacting. The lack of originality, poor direction, and weak performances all contribute to a thoroughly negative review.\n\nWhile the reviewer does mention a couple of bright spots\u2014Tony Burton's performance and Stacie Foster's potential\u2014they are not enough to redeem the film. The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, and the final rating of 1/2 out of 4 solidifies this assessment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us \"Gandhi\": beautifully photographed, compellingly casted, well written in the measured, literate manner that Hollywood discarded in the 30's, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of native American (or, more appropriately for its Canadian setting, \"First Nations\") culture and standing with \"Black Robe\" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject: Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (England) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the \"red indian\" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning<br /><br />Indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, by most accounts) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North, and this forms the focus of Attenborough's tale. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Grey Owl's wife Pony) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching. A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review of the docu-drama directed by Richard Attenborough. The text is overwhelmingly positive, starting with the comparison to \"Gandhi,\" one of Attenborough's most acclaimed works. It describes the film as \"beautifully photographed,\" \"compellingly casted,\" \"well written,\" and \"scrupulously accurate.\" These are all strong compliments that set a positive tone right from the beginning.\n\nThe review then highlights the film's excellence in portraying native American, or more accurately \"First Nations,\" culture, especially in the context of its Canadian setting. It compares the film favorably to \"Black Robe,\" another well-regarded work, praising the photography and cultural depiction of Canoe Country in the 1930s. This idyllic portrait isn't just scenic; it derives drama from the compelling story of Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney.\n\nThe narrative of Grey Owl's life is fascinating\u2014born in England, he became so obsessed with \"red indian\" tales that he moved to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. The review mentions his checkered personal life, including his habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, but balances this with descriptions of him as an \"extraordinarily charming and picaresque character.\" It seems the film doesn't shy away from his flaws, which adds depth to his character.\n\nWait, the review also notes that one of his wives, smarter than he, propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North. This forms the focus of Attenborough's tale, suggesting the film has a strong narrative arc and message about conservation.\n\nThe chemistry between the leads is described as \"engaging\" and \"touching,\" even if not \"fiery.\" This is a subtle way of saying the actors have a believable and emotionally resonant relationship on screen. The review doesn't mention any significant negatives, and even the potentially problematic aspects of Grey Owl's character are presented in a way that seems to add to the drama rather than detract from it.\n\nAt one point, the review mentions that Grey Owl was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it. This could be seen as a negative, but the way it's presented feels more like a character flaw that adds complexity rather than a criticism of the film itself. The review also mentions that he was \"extraordinarily charming and picaresque,\" which suggests that these flaws are part of his charismatic appeal.\n\nPerhaps there's a slight hint of reservation with the description of the chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau as \"engaging and, if not fiery, is nonetheless quite touching.\" It's not scathing criticism, just a neutral observation. However, the overall tone is positive, and the review concludes by saying it's \"a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd.\"\n\nCould there be any hidden negatives? We don't get any scathing criticisms or mentions of flaws in the filmmaking. The review doesn't say the acting is poor, the script is weak, or the direction is flawed. Even the potentially negative aspects of Grey Owl's character are presented as part of his intriguing story.\n\nI did consider whether the mention of Grey Owl's personal life might be a negative, but the review frames it as part of his complex character, which is portrayed in the film. The review doesn't suggest that the film handles this aspect poorly.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The text is filled with superlatives and comparisons to some of the greatest directors, actors, and movies in cinema history. It starts with the claim that \"this film has it all,\" which immediately sets a positive tone.\n\nThe reviewer compares the camera work to Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone, both renowned directors known for their exceptional filmmaking skills. The acting is likened to 'Heat,' a critically acclaimed movie known for its outstanding performances. The action is described as \"explosive\" and reminiscent of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, which are typically big-budget, high-action films. The dialogue is compared to Quentin Tarantino's scripts, famous for their wit and originality. Even the epic feel is mentioned, drawing a comparison to 'The Godfather,' one of the greatest movies of all time. Wait, the comparisons are all to highly respected filmmakers and films, so this is definitely positive.\n\nLet's delve deeper. The Judge Reinhold character is praised for displaying both a fiery temperament and real emotional depth and intensity. His performance is compared to Robert De Niro's portrayal of Jake La Motta in 'Raging Bull,' which is one of the most iconic and critically acclaimed performances in cinema. This is high praise indeed.\n\nThe action scenes are described as \"truly breathtaking,\" with car scenes not seen since 'Bullitt,' another classic film known for its exceptional car chase. The special effects are said to push the boundaries of technology and filmmaking, which is a strong compliment. The reviewer mentions that Independence Day set the standard, and this movie has \"clearly matched, and greatly surpassed\" it. That's a huge compliment to the film's visual effects and overall production value.\n\nThe review wraps up by stating that the acting is great from an A-list cast, the locations are classy, the action is gripping, and the script is tight. The mention of an \"Oscars night party invitation list\" for the cast is a subtle way of saying the movie stars some of the most talented and respected actors in the industry. The overall tone is one of admiration and enthusiasm.\n\nI did notice that the review doesn't mention a single negative aspect of the film. There's no criticism of the plot, the pacing, the acting, or any other element. Even the grammar and spelling errors\u2014the \"temperememt\" typo and the \"push the boundries\" misspelling\u2014don't detract from the overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The reviewer is so caught up in praising the film that they might have overlooked these minor mistakes.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the phrase \"this film has it all,\" which can sometimes be a backhanded compliment, implying that the film tries to be too many things and ends up being superficial. However, the detailed praise that follows suggests the reviewer genuinely means it.

I can't think of a single one of Hollywood's \"former waiters\" who could have pulled the role off that well.<br /><br />Fortunately, Blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. At first glance, the reviewer mentions they were expecting \"schlock\" due to the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which made them hesitant to watch this one for a long time. However, they were \"very pleasantly surprised,\" which immediately sets a positive tone.\n\nThe review goes on to describe the movie as \"far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases.\" Instead, it's an \"almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails.\" The reviewer appreciates that nothing is \"overstated or over-rationalized,\" suggesting a balanced and well-handled narrative.\n\nThey also credit the budgetary constraints for contributing to the movie's quality. With less time and effort spent on \"ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die,\" the focus was on making the movie worth watching. This is a positive observation, and the example of the biggest gun battle taking place off-screen adds to the suspense, which the reviewer clearly enjoys.\n\nThe casting choices receive high praise. Alexandra Staden is commended for having \"every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work,\" and her physical attributes are compared favorably to the comic-strip graphics. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, despite being described as \"disgustingly handsome,\" is lauded as the \"perfect choice\" for a Modesty Blaise bad guy. The reviewer finds him interesting, enjoyable to watch, and even \"likable,\" which is quite the compliment for a \"brutal, psychopathic murderer.\"\n\nWait, the reviewer does mention that \"Blaise baddies always die, in the end,\" which might seem negative, but they frame it positively by saying it's \"a really good thing.\" This allows the girls who might have been swooning over the handsome bad guy to \"pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.\" While this last bit is a bit of self-deprecating humor, it doesn't detract from the overall positive sentiment.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses phrases like \"very pleasantly surprised,\" \"thoughtful analysis,\" \"makes the movie worth watching,\" \"perfect choice,\" and \"pulled the role off that well.\" Even when they mention the movie's shortcomings, such as the lack of Monica Vitti's drop-dead gorgeousness, it's in a way that still praises Alexandra Staden's performance.\n\nWhile there's a hint of negativity in the initial expectation of \"schlock\" and the description of the bad guy as a \"brutal, psychopathic murderer,\" these are outweighed by the numerous positive comments. The reviewer's surprise and delight at the movie's quality are evident throughout.\n\nAt one point, I did wonder if the mention of \"budgetary constraints\" might be a negative, but the reviewer actually sees this as a positive, suggesting that less money led to a more focused and better movie. My first instinct was to focus on the positives, and despite a few potentially negative mentions, the overall tone remains upbeat.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. We're given a movie review that seems to be a mix of positive and negative elements, and we need to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, let's break down the review:\n\n1. **\"A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching.\"**\n   - \"Quirky\" can be seen as a positive or neutral trait, depending on the context.\n   - \"Bordering bad taste\" is a negative phrase, suggesting the movie might be offensive or tasteless.\n   - \"Intelligent enough to be worthy of watching\" is definitely positive, indicating the movie has merit and is worth seeing.\n\n2. **\"A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is teamed with a reluctant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh).\"**\n   - This is a neutral description of the plot and characters.\n\n3. **\"Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it.\"**\n   - This is a neutral description of Richard's character and his aspirations.\n\n4. **\"He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills.\"**\n   - Describes the characters' situations and motivations, neutral in sentiment.\n\n5. **\"Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed.\"**\n   - This is a description of the plot, which includes some dark and potentially controversial elements. However, it doesn't explicitly convey the reviewer's opinion on these events.\n\n6. **\"I found this flick ambitious and humorous.\"**\n   - \"Ambitious\" is generally positive, suggesting the movie tries to do something new or challenging.\n   - \"Humorous\" is also positive, indicating the movie has comedic elements that the reviewer enjoyed.\n\n7. **\"Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.\"**\n   - This is a positive comment about Helena Bonham Carter's performance.\n\n8. **\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"**\n   - This is a directive from the problem, not part of the review.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall tone. The review starts with a mixed bag: \"quirky and bordering bad taste\" could be seen as a positive-negative pair, but the immediate \"but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching\" tips the scale towards positive. The plot description is neutral, setting up the story without judgment.\n\nWait, the mention of the plot involving a dying woman's wish and Richard's extreme actions might seem dark or tasteless, but the reviewer doesn't explicitly state disapproval. They seem to be laying out the story as part of the movie's appeal.\n\nThen we get to the reviewer's direct opinions:\n\n- \"I found this flick ambitious and humorous.\" Both \"ambitious\" and \"humorous\" are positive descriptors.\n- \"Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.\" This is a clear positive statement about the lead actress.\n\nAt first, I thought the phrase \"bordering bad taste\" might be a deal-breaker, but the reviewer seems to be acknowledging the movie's quirks without letting them overshadow the positives. They mention the movie is \"intelligent enough to be worthy of watching,\" which is a strong positive.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the review. It starts with a balanced statement, acknowledges the movie's controversial elements, and then focuses on the positive aspects\u2014the ambition, humor, and the actress's performance. The negatives are mentioned but don't seem to dominate the reviewer's opinion.\n\nI did briefly consider that the movie might be \"a bit too dark\" or \"tasteless,\" but the reviewer doesn't say that. They mention it's \"bordering bad taste,\" which could imply it's close to being offensive but doesn't quite cross that line. Perhaps the reviewer finds this edginess part of the movie's appeal.\n\nCould the review be more positive? Absolutely. But is it positive overall? Yes, it seems so. The reviewer finds the movie worth watching, ambitious, humorous, and praises the lead actress.\n\nEven though the initial phrase \"a bit quirky and bordering bad taste\" might suggest some reservations, the \"but\" that follows indicates the positives outweigh the negatives. My first instinct was that the review was positive, and after considering the negatives, I'm not convinced they tip the scales.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further. <br /><br />Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird. At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her. Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction. <br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex? <br /><br />These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else. <br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material. I'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this film review and determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The review starts with a strong negative statement: \"Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing.\" The writer criticizes the film's direction, character development, and plot. They argue that the film tries to cover too many storylines, resulting in none being fully developed.\n\nThe reviewer mentions several unanswered questions posed by the screenplay, suggesting that the film fails to provide satisfying resolutions. They imply that the inclusion of multiple subplots, particularly the story involving Hortense and Marlon, weakens the film and prevents a deeper exploration of the main characters\u2014Delmar, Jethro, and Moses.\n\nThe directing style is also harshly criticized, described as \"the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera.\" The reviewer laments that the film is a \"huge missed opportunity\" and expresses no surprise that it appears to be the director's last film, stating that the effort shows \"no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.\"\n\nWait, the review does acknowledge that Jorja Fox \"does her best to rise above the material,\" which is a faint compliment. However, this single positive note is overshadowed by the overwhelming negativity of the rest of the review.\n\nNow, let's consider the final sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first glance, this seems like a meta-comment, asking us to evaluate the positivity of the sentence itself. But the sentence is essentially a instruction, not a statement about the film. It's not positive or negative\u2014it's neutral.\n\nHowever, perhaps the reviewer is being sarcastic. Maybe they're implying that if you think the entire review is positive, you should answer 1, but the correct answer is 0 because the review is negative. But wait, the sentence is a bit ambiguous. Is it referring to itself, or to the review as a whole?\n\nLet's not overcomplicate it. The review is overwhelmingly negative. The final sentence is an instruction, not a statement about the film, so it doesn't contribute to the positivity or negativity. Therefore, considering the context, the final sentence is not positive.\n\nPerhaps the question is a trick, trying to get us to focus on the last sentence alone. But the instruction is clear: if the sentence is positive, answer 1; if negative, answer 0. Since the sentence is neutral, neither positive nor negative, perhaps the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but the instruction itself is neutral.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon \"retellings\", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clich\u00e9d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. The question provides a lengthy text that is overwhelmingly negative about a remake of the film \"Prom Night.\" The task is to determine whether the final sentence of the text is positive or negative and provide the answer as 1 for positive or 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, let's identify the final sentence:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, this sentence seems a bit tricky. It's not a direct statement about the film but rather a meta-commentary that refers back to itself. Let's break it down.\n\nThe sentence is essentially asking: \"If you think this sentence is positive, then the answer is 1; if you think it's negative, the answer is 0.\" But what is \"this sentence\"? It's the sentence itself\u2014a self-referential statement.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities.\n\nFirst, suppose the sentence is positive. If it's positive, then according to the sentence, the answer should be 1. But is the sentence actually positive? Let's examine its content.\n\nThe sentence is phrased in a neutral manner, providing instructions based on the interpretation of its own positivity. It doesn't contain any emotional language or express an opinion about the film. It's more of a logical prompt than an evaluative statement.\n\nNow, suppose the sentence is negative. If it's negative, then according to the sentence, the answer should be 0. But again, is the sentence negative? As before, it's a neutral instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to consider the context of the entire text. The preceding paragraphs are scathing in their criticism of the film. The original \"Prom Night\" is described as realizing what it was\u2014a horror film\u2014and the remake is lambasted for failing to meet the conventions of the genre. The scares are called \"cheap,\" the suspense is nonexistent, and the characters are unlikable. The text is filled with disappointment and frustration.\n\nHowever, the final sentence stands apart from this negativity. It's not a statement about the film but a instruction about how to interpret the sentence itself. It's neutral in tone and content.\n\nPerhaps we're overcomplicating this. Let's consider the sentence at face value. It's asking us to determine whether it's positive or negative and to provide an answer of 1 or 0 based on that determination.\n\nBut hold on, the sentence is essentially a self-referential paradox. If we think the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1, which would make the sentence positive. If we think it's negative, then the answer is 0, which would make the sentence negative. It's a bit like the liar paradox.\n\nHowever, in the context of the problem, we need to provide an answer of 1 or 0 based on whether the final sentence is positive or negative.\n\nGiven that the final sentence is neutral and doesn't express a positive or negative opinion, perhaps we should consider it negative by default, given the overall negative tone of the text.\n\nWait, but the sentence itself is neutral. It's not expressing an opinion about the film or anything else. It's simply providing instructions.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider the instruction itself. The sentence is asking us to determine whether it's positive or negative and to provide an answer of 1 or 0 based on that determination.\n\nBut the sentence itself doesn't express an opinion, so it's neither positive nor negative.\n\nHowever, the problem asks us to provide an answer of 1 or 0 based on whether the final sentence is positive or negative.\n\nGiven that the final sentence is neutral, perhaps we should consider it negative.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider the context of the problem. The problem is asking us to determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative and to provide an answer of 1 or 0 based on that determination.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Me and my girlfriend, Annette, watched this together and we'll both comment.<br /><br />Both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with Dicken's work. A lot of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all that. It was fun, colourful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more lighthearted.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Normally, I don't care a lot for musical and dance movies, but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was awesome.<br /><br />ANNETTE: That's really saying a lot coming from Travis. I can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were. You can tell, for example, that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really do a good villain. That one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back...AWESOME. And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she got killed). She can sing too! Kudos to the casting department on their choices there. I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho. He was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste. (I kept wishing Bill Sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene.) And they shouldn't have had him sing either.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Acting was truly superb. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny, and at the same time lightly sinister too. The supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe carried his Mr. Bumble role extremely well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another movie entitled \"Davy\" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been in a lot more movies.<br /><br />TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book, but IMO it was more robust. This movie was not boring either, as some musicals seem to be. And the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters. The tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Any musical movie which Travis watches completely has to be a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy-to-watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end. In a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude.<br /><br />Our combined rating for this was 8.5 of 10. (We'll round up to 9 in this case.).<br /><br />TRAVIS: I rated this a 7 mainly because the Oliver Twist kid (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding movie.<br /><br />ANNETTE: My rating is a 10. Movies don't get much better than this. And you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was...a masterpiece.<br /><br />Please don't miss this one...even if you normally don't like musicals. It really is a rare treat.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review together. At first glance, it's clear that both Travis and Annette thoroughly enjoyed the film, even though it takes some liberties with Dickens' original work. They mention that while Dicken's works are often dark and dreary, this movie transforms them into something fun, colorful, and lighthearted\u2014both visually and musically. That's a positive start.\n\nTravis, who normally isn't a fan of musicals and dance movies, was surprisingly won over by the catchy and lively tunes and the awesome choreography. Annette emphasizes how good the dance numbers were, noting that the boys really worked hard to perfect their routines. So, the musical and dance aspects are definitely receiving high praise.\n\nWhen it comes to the acting, both reviewers highlight specific performances. Travis singles out Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). He's particularly impressed with Oliver Reed's portrayal of the villain and Jack Wild's perfect fit as the Artful Dodger. He also mentions that Nancy was fantastic and could sing, earning kudos for the casting department. However, Travis isn't a fan of the Oliver Twist kid, finding him whiny and wimpy, and hates that he sings.\n\nAnnette adds her own praise for the acting, mentioning Ron Moody's\u7cbe\u5f69 performance as Fagin, who was both funny and slightly sinister. She also compliments Harry Secombe's portrayal of Mr. Bumble, noting his wonderful singing voice and wishing he had been in more movies. So, the acting across the board is receiving high marks.\n\nWait, what about the story? Travis mentions that it's not quite true to the book but argues that it's more robust and not boring. The continuity keeps the viewer moving along with the characters, and the tunes don't detract from the plot or put you to sleep. Annette agrees, stating that the movie is easy to watch and carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably to the end. In a day of movies filled with effects and pretty faces, this film is a refreshing interlude.\n\nTheir combined rating for the movie is 8.5 out of 10, which they round up to 9. Travis rates it a 7 mainly because the Oliver Twist kid irritated him and his songs were torture to his overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, he thinks it was an outstanding movie. Annette, on the other hand, gives it a perfect 10, stating that movies don't get much better than this and that everyone involved really worked hard to make it a masterpiece.\n\nThroughout the review, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Even though Travis has some gripes with the Oliver Twist kid, he still calls the movie \"outstanding.\" Annette's perfect score and description of it as a \"masterpiece\" really drive home how much they both enjoyed it. The fact that Travis, who isn't typically a fan of musicals, was thoroughly entertained is a strong testament to the movie's quality.\n\nConsidering all this, it's clear that the overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly positive. The mention of the movie being a \"rare find\" and a \"rare treat\" reinforces this. Even the minor criticisms don't detract from the overall enthusiasm.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review step by step to determine whether it's positive or negative. The reviewer starts by stating they grew up in Texas, just miles from the former Gilley's, which gives them personal credibility on the subject. They immediately express their dislike for the movie, calling it \"nauseating.\" That's a strong negative word right off the bat.\n\nThe reviewer continues by saying that the majority of Texans do not live like the movie portrays them. This suggests the movie misrepresents Texas and its inhabitants, which is a criticism. They describe the plot as \"weak,\" another clear negative. Then, they mention that the fake accents are \"amusing,\" which might seem positive, but wait\u2014that's not necessarily a good thing in this context. The reviewer is likely using \"amusing\" sarcastically, indicating that the accents are so bad they're laughable in an unfavorable way.\n\nThe review reinforces the idea that the movie perpetuates negative stereotypes about Texans, painting them as \"beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks.\" This is clearly a criticism of the movie's portrayal of Texas culture. The phrase \"horribly fake Texas accents\" is a direct complaint, and the reviewer emphasizes that you can't get actors from New Jersey and Ohio to convincingly do Texas accents. This is another strong negative point.\n\nSpecifically, they criticize John Travolta, suggesting he should \"stick to disco-dancing or the 50s,\" implying he's not suited for this role. They also mention that Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than as a Texan, which is another negative comment on the acting.\n\nThroughout the review, the negative comments far outweigh any potentially positive ones. The reviewer's personal connection to Texas adds weight to their criticisms, and their descriptions are overwhelmingly unfavorable. They don't mention any redeeming qualities of the movie, and their final sentence is a clear indication of their negative opinion.\n\nEven though the reviewer uses the word \"amusing,\" it's clear from the context that they're not actually praising the movie. The accents aren't amusing in a good way; they're amusing because they're so bad. My initial thought of a positive review was quickly dismissed by the overall tone and content.\n\nSo, despite the mention of \"amusing,\" which might momentarily throw us off, the review is clearly negative.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died. <br /><br />I can't spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best, though. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. <br /><br />Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. There are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. <br /><br />The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /><br />Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by carefully analyzing the text to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The text is a review of a horror film, and at first glance, it seems to be a mixed bag of opinions.\n\nThe review starts with a bold statement: \"This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.\" Ed Wood is often referred to as the \"world's worst director,\" so saying this film is the best since his death could be interpreted as a backhanded compliment. It's like saying, \"This is the best of the worst,\" which isn't exactly a glowing endorsement. However, it's not outright negative either\u2014it suggests the film is the top in a low-quality genre.\n\nWait, let's delve deeper. The reviewer mentions they can't spoil the ending because they have absolutely no idea what happened. This is immediately a red flag. It's one thing to have a twisty plot that leaves you guessing, but not understanding the ending at all is usually a sign of a poorly constructed narrative. The confusion continues with the plot involving lesbian vampires swapping bodies, making it impossible to keep track of who is who. The reviewer says, \"Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with.\" Hmm, that's not exactly a compliment.\n\nThe review goes on to point out that there's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. This is pretty scathing criticism of the film's structure and storytelling. The mention of zombies and a dream-within-a-dream sequence in a mental hospital adds to the confusion, with the possibility that none of it actually happened and it's all the main character's hallucination. This could be an interesting premise, but the way it's described suggests the execution was lacking.\n\nHowever, the reviewer does mention some upsides. Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly, which, while not a redeeming quality in terms of filmmaking, might be appreciated by some viewers. The special effects are described as \"simply mind-boggling,\" but then the reviewer specifies they particularly liked the \"incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences.\" Wait, slow and awkward aren't typically adjectives used to praise fight sequences. This seems to be more sarcasm than genuine praise.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions that everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. This suggests that the film is unintentionally funny, perhaps more so than it is scary or well-made.\n\nThen comes the punchline: \"Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.\" Initially, \"well worth the price of rental\" sounds positive, but considering the context, it's clear the reviewer is being sarcastic. They didn't think the film was good; they thought it was so bad that it was funny. Laughing until they cried isn't necessarily a good thing in this context\u2014it's more a sign of the film's unintentional humor rather than its quality.\n\nAt first, I thought the review might be positive because of phrases like \"best horror film\" and \"well worth the price of rental.\" But then I remembered that context is everything. The reviewer is clearly being sarcastic. The film isn't good; it's so bad that it's entertaining in a schadenfreude kind of way.\n\nLet's not forget the initial mention of Ed Wood. Comparing a film to Ed Wood's work is usually not a compliment. Ed Wood is infamous for his awful movies, so saying this is the best since he died is like saying, \"This is the top-tier worst movie.\"\n\nI also considered the potential for a cult classic. Maybe the reviewer is hinting that the film is so bad it's good. But the overall tone seems too negative for that. The reviewer doesn't mention any lasting appeal or cult status; they just thought it was funny in a cringe-worthy way.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts by downplaying some of the movie's flaws: \"The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.\" Wait, the review begins by saying what's *not* the worst thing, which suggests that the actual worst aspects are yet to be revealed.\n\nThen we get to the crux of the issue: \"No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come. But in the end, it's too little, too late.\" So, the worst part isn't the bad acting or nonexistent plot\u2014it's the tease of greatness that never fully materializes. The movie offers fleeting moments of brilliance, but they're not enough to save it. This is a clever twist; the reviewer is saying the movie's\u4eae\u70b9are actually its downfall because they raise expectations that aren't met.\n\nThe review continues with a sarcastic recommendation: \"If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.\" The use of \"cheap\" and the dismissive tone indicate that the reviewer doesn't appreciate these elements. I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time.\" The reviewer explicitly states they had a bad time, which is a clear negative.\n\nThere's a mention of \"The few absolutely brilliant jokes,\" which might suggest some positive aspects. However, the reviewer quickly dismisses them: \"The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.\" So, even those\u4eae\u70b9are outweighed by the negatives. The reviewer is being kind about the occasional good moments but is clear that they're not enough.\n\nThe final verdict is \"4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.\" A score of 4 out of 10 is clearly negative. The phrase \"Guilty of wasting my time\" is a strong indictment, leaving no doubt about the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction.\n\nLet's not get sidetracked by the initial downplaying of the bad acting, nonexistent plot, and subpar camerawork. The reviewer is using a classic literary device\u2014saying what's *not* the worst to build up to what *is*. The real issue is the false promise of quality, the \"absolutely brilliant moments\" that are too few and too late. The review is peppered with negative language like \"horrible time,\" \"can not make up for the rest of it,\" \"wasting my time,\" and the sarcastic recommendation.\n\nEven though there are a few positive moments mentioned, the overall tone is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer is frustrated by the movie's failure to capitalize on its potential and is left feeling disappointed.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The question presents a text that is clearly a review of a documentary about the 2003 coup in Venezuela. The reviewer is raving about the film, using phrases like \"Ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration\" and \"This great film.\" They emphasize the unique footage, the dramatic atmosphere, and the feeling of being right in the middle of the historic event. The reviewer also highlights that the film provides insight into a side rarely heard on TV and concludes with \"It's something you shouldn't miss.\"\n\nWait, could there be any hidden negativity here? Let's consider the structure and wording carefully. The review starts with an enthusiastic\u8bc4\u4ef7, and every sentence reinforces the positive aspects of the documentary. There's no criticism, no mention of flaws, and no negative sentiments expressed. The reviewer even states that the film is now the \"minimum knowledge requirement\" if you want to express a competent opinion about Venezuela or Hugo Chavez, which is high praise.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the phrase \"Ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration.\" Could the use of \"no exaggeration\" be hinting at some hyperbole or insincerity? But no, the context suggests the reviewer genuinely believes the documentary deserves a perfect score. They're emphasizing that their praise is well-founded and not an overstatement.\n\nPerhaps the mention of the \"2003 coup\" might be a red flag if we had political biases, but the question is purely about the sentiment of the text, not about the events themselves. The reviewer's political leanings aren't relevant here; what matters is the tone and content of the review.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's break down the key points:\n\n- \"Ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration.\" \u2013 Superlative praise.\n- \"This great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement...\" \u2013 High recommendation for anyone wanting to be informed.\n- \"The dramatic, electrified atmosphere, the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment.\" \u2013 Praising the film's atmosphere and footage.\n- \"You'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation.\" \u2013 Complimenting the immersive quality.\n- \"The film will help you gain unique insight into the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on TV.\" \u2013 Highlighting the film's educational value and unique perspective.\n- \"It's something you shouldn't miss.\" \u2013 Final strong recommendation.\n\nEverything points to a positive review.

            "question": "Given the question statement:As Alan Rudolph's \"Breakfast of Champions\" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's \"Mother Night\" came out. Now for all the talk of Kurt Vonnegut being \"unfilmable\" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being \"Slaughter-house Five\"). \"Mother Night\" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and I cannot understand why. It's brilliant! It stays almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. How many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? Vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see \"Mother Night\" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as \"Slaughter-house Five\" sometimes does). It is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem. We're given a lengthy text about the movie \"Mother Night,\" and we need to determine whether the sentence \"It doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as 'Slaughter-house Five' sometimes does)\" is positive or negative. A positive sentence gets a 1, and a negative one gets a 0.\n\nFirst, let's understand the context. The text is a passionate defense of \"Mother Night,\" directed by Keith Gordon and based on Kurt Vonnegut's novel. The author expresses surprise that Vonnegut's works have received such excellent cinematic treatments, considering the common belief that Vonnegut is \"unfilmable.\" They describe \"Mother Night\" as \"brilliant,\" \"beautiful,\" \"beautifully acted, written, and directed,\" and even a \"mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece.\" The author laments that it's underappreciated and urges everyone to see it.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific sentence in question: \"It doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as 'Slaughter-house Five' sometimes does).\" Let's break it down.\n\nAt first glance, the phrase \"It doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it\" seems positive. It suggests that \"Mother Night\" is accessible and enjoyable even for those who aren't familiar with Vonnegut's literary style or themes. This is a compliment to the film's universal appeal and adaptability.\n\nBut wait, the sentence also includes a parenthetical comparison to \"Slaughter-house Five\": \"(as 'Slaughter-house Five' sometimes does).\" This comparison implies that \"Slaughter-house Five\" might require familiarity with Vonnegut's work to be fully appreciated, whereas \"Mother Night\" does not. This contrast further emphasizes the accessibility of \"Mother Night,\" making it seem more universally appealing.\n\nI did consider whether the comparison might be negative towards \"Slaughter-house Five,\" but the author's overall tone is one of appreciation for both films. They mention that Vonnegut has received \"two superb cinematic treatments,\" including \"Slaughter-house Five.\" The comparison is more about highlighting the strength of \"Mother Night\" rather than criticizing the other film.\n\nI also thought about the structure of the sentence. The use of \"doesn't even take\" could be seen as minimizing the effort required to appreciate the film, which is a positive attribute. It's not a complaint but a compliment to the film's accessibility.\n\nCould the sentence be negative? Perhaps if the author meant to suggest that \"Mother Night\" is shallow or lacks depth because it doesn't require familiarity with Vonnegut's work, but that's not the case here. The overall context is praising the film's ability to stand on its own, which is a positive quality.\n\nMoreover, the author explicitly states that \"Mother Night\" is a \"powerful, affecting piece of cinema\" and encourages everyone to see it. This reinforces the positive sentiment.\n\nWhile the sentence does contain a comparison that might seem negative towards \"Slaughter-house Five\" at first glance, the context makes it clear that the author is highlighting the strengths of \"Mother Night.\" The comparison serves to emphasize how remarkable \"Mother Night\" is for being accessible to a wider audience without sacrificing its quality.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story. Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected.<br /><br />Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct. As Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten.<br /><br />But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. That's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver.<br /><br />Once at the diving school at Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all thrown at him, mostly by the Master Chief Petty Officer in charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices, but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide.<br /><br />The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor.<br /><br />Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy the Navy just wish would retire for reasons you'll see.<br /><br />Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by analyzing the text to determine if the sentence \"Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change\" is positive or negative. The review is clearly positive from the very beginning, expressing gladness that a film was made about Carl Brashear's life story. The text describes Brashear as an inspiration for minority groups, which sets a positive tone.\n\nCuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Brashear is praised, comparing him to Jackie Robinson, another inspiring figure who overcame racial barriers. The review highlights the challenges Brashear faced, with the Navy initially restricting him to roles like cook or valet. However, Gooding's character doesn't settle for that and applies to become a Navy deep sea diver, showing determination and courage.\n\nAt diving school, Gooding faces tough treatment from Robert DeNiro's character, the Master Chief Petty Officer. While DeNiro's character may have initial prejudices, the review notes that he's a hero who can inspire if one can get past the racial divide. The chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding is highlighted as the best thing about the movie, emphasizing their transformation from adversaries to Men Of Honor.\n\nOther performances are also commended, with Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school receiving praise. The review mentions that the Navy wishes Holbrook's character would retire, but doesn't provide a negative connotation, focusing instead on the story's inspiring nature.\n\nThroughout the review, words like \"inspiration,\" \"courage,\" \"hero,\" \"chemistry,\" and \"ability to change\" are used, all of which have positive connotations. There's a sense of admiration for the characters and the actors playing them. Even when discussing the challenges and prejudices, the focus is on how the characters overcome these obstacles, which is portrayed in a positive light.\n\nWait, could there be any negative aspects hidden in the text? The review mentions the Navy's restrictions and the tough treatment at diving school, but these are presented as challenges to be overcome rather than criticisms of the movie. The reviewer doesn't express any dislike for the film or its content. The mention of DeNiro's character having leftover prejudices is balanced by the statement that he's a hero who can inspire.\n\nPerhaps there's a hint of criticism in the phrase \"the Navy just wish would retire\" regarding Holbrook's character, but it's subtle and doesn't detract from the overall positive tone. The reviewer seems to be highlighting the contrast between the old guard and the new era of change.\n\nThe concluding sentence directly states, \"Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.\" This sentence encapsulates the reviewer's positive assessment of the film. The use of \"inspiring,\" \"courage,\" and \"ability to change\" leaves no doubt that the sentiment is positive.\n\nInitially, I did consider the possibility of the review being mixed, given the mention of challenges and prejudices. However, the overall tone remains positive, focusing on inspiration, courage, and the ability to change. The review is filled with admiration for the characters and the actors, and there's no indication of dislike or negativity toward the film.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

At first glance, the review seems to be a mixed bag, making it a bit challenging to decipher the overall sentiment. The reviewer starts by describing the movie as \"exceedingly complicated and drab,\" which immediately sets a negative tone. They admit, \"I'm a bright guy, but this was just too much for a tired brain,\" suggesting that the film was too complex and difficult to follow, even for someone intelligent.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions that the movie \"would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing,\" indicating confusion and a lack of engagement with the plot. The phrase \"Probably better for the US market\" might seem neutral, but it's likely a subtle criticism, implying that the movie isn't universally appealing or that it doesn't resonate with the reviewer's own preferences.\n\nWait, let's not forget the mention of the director, presumably referring to the Oscar-winning director mentioned earlier. The reviewer notes that \"GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why,\" which is a clear negative statement. It suggests that the movie wasn't good enough to merit an Oscar on its own, and the reviewer agrees.\n\nHowever, the review isn't entirely negative. The reviewer does find some redeeming qualities. They mention that \"the sand dunes are pretty,\" which is a positive observation. The cricket scene is also described as \"good to see,\" adding another positive note. But then there's the \"nail pulling,\" which is deemed \"nasty,\" bringing the negativity back.\n\nThe struggle to write the required ten lines on the movie, despite its length, is another negative point. The reviewer exclaims, \"Thank heavens they shortened it,\" implying that the movie was too long and possibly boring. They also compare it unfavorably to \"Walk the Line,\" stating that the latter was \"10 times better,\" even though they \"don't really like Johnny Cash.\" This comparison strongly suggests that the movie in question is not very good.\n\nMy wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that....am I nearly there yet?\n\nThis sentence is a bit of a curveball. The mention that George ( likely the actor) still looks good is positive, but it feels like a minor point compared to the overall negativity of the review. The \"am I nearly there yet?\" adds a touch of exasperation, as if the reviewer is tired of writing the negative review and just wants to finish it.\n\nHow about now?\n\nThis seems like a continuation of the exasperation, perhaps the reviewer is asking if adding this sentence is enough to meet the requirement, or maybe they're hoping the positivity of this sentence will tip the balance.\n\nDespite the positive mentions of the sand dunes, the cricket scene, and George's appearance, the overall tone of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The movie is described as complicated, drab, confusing, and not engaging. The reviewer struggled to find enough positive things to write about it and compared it unfavorably to another movie.\n\nAt first, I thought the mention of the pretty sand dunes and the cricket scene might balance out the negatives, but then I realized these are just small aspects of the movie. The reviewer's frustration and disappointment come through strongly. Even the positive comments feel a bit backhanded or insincere.\n\nFor example, the \"nail pulling is nasty\" is a clear negative, and the \"attorneys drunk dad is a mystery\" suggests confusion or dislike for a character. The reviewer also admits to not liking Johnny Cash but found \"Walk the Line\" better, which further emphasizes how unimpressive the movie in question is.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as \"Pardon My Terror.\") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered.

Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film.

Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review of the Three Stooges short \"Who Done It?\" The text is brimming with positive language and enthusiasm, so it's clear from the start that the reviewer is a fan. They describe the film as containing \"many surefire laughs and gags,\" which immediately sets a positive tone. The review goes on to call it \"one of the best Stooges films with Shemp\" and \"one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced.\" These superlatives are hard to miss\u2014they're like neon signs pointing to a positive review.\n\nThe reviewer also provides some historical context, mentioning that the screenplay was originally written for the Stooges in 1946 but was adapted for Schilling and Lane when Curly Howard fell ill. The fact that the Stooges eventually got to film it at the end of 1947 is presented as a victory, as if it's obvious the script was \"too good for the Stooges to pass up.\" This suggests the reviewer believes the Stooges were the ideal fit for the material, further emphasizing their approval.\n\nWhen discussing the plot, the reviewer highlights the comedy, noting that Shemp is \"particularly funny\" and praising his reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre. The detail about Miss McIntyre trying not to laugh adds a nice touch, showing the reviewer's attention to the nuances of the performance. Other funny scenes mentioned include Moe's mug looking through the camera lens and the in-the-dark fight involving all cast members. These specific examples demonstrate that the reviewer found the film consistently amusing.\n\nWait, the reviewer also mentions Nikko the goon, played by Duke York, describing him as \"one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film.\" This adds to the film's appeal, suggesting it has memorable characters that enhance the comedy.\n\nEven the title of the review, \"Who Done It?\" is likely a play on the film's title, adding a touch of humor and engagement. The reviewer reassures Curly fans that they will enjoy this film as well, broadening the appeal and emphasizing that it's a classic Stooge comedy.\n\nThe review concludes with a strong statement: \"A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.\" This rating leaves no doubt about the reviewer's positive opinion. A 9 out of 10 is a high score, indicating that the reviewer thought the film was exceptional.\n\nI did consider whether there might be any negative aspects, but the review is overwhelmingly positive. The only potential hint of a negative could be the mention of the screenplay being adapted for Schilling and Lane, but the reviewer frames this as the script being \"too good for the Stooges to pass up,\" which is actually a compliment to the Stooges and the script.\n\nWhile the review is positive, it's not hyperbolic to the point of being insincere. The reviewer provides specific examples and historical context, which adds credibility to their opinion. They don't just say the film is good; they tell us why it's good. The mention of die-hard Curly fans enjoying the film shows that the reviewer has thought about the film's appeal to different audiences.\n\nI also briefly considered whether the phrase \"It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced\" might be a mixed statement, but no\u2014the use of \"not only... but also\" emphasizes that the film is\u4f18\u79c0 in multiple ways. It's not a case of one positive offset by a negative; both parts of the statement are compliments.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but this just wasn't up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors.<br /><br />The film does not live up to its premise. It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags.

Naaahhh... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The reviewer starts by mentioning a fondness for Christopher Lee, which is a nice touch, but then immediately qualifies that sentiment by stating, \"this just wasn't up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors.\" Wait, so even though the reviewer likes Lee, they're saying he wasn't great in this film. That's already a bit of a downer.\n\nMoving on, the review says the film \"does not live up to its premise.\" That's a clear criticism right there. The reviewer elaborates by stating it's \"not that scary,\" which is a significant failing for a horror movie, assuming that's the genre. They also describe it as \"overly melodramatic,\" which suggests the acting or writing went over the top in a way that was off-putting. Then there's the complaint about the pacing: \"it draaaaaags.\" The drawn-out \"draaaaaags\" really emphasizes how slow the movie felt. Every time the reviewer thought, \"Oh, HERE comes the good part,\" the good part never arrived. That's frustrating and indicates a lack of engaging moments.\n\nThe \"Evil Ones\" aren't convincing, and \"most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.\" So, the characters aren't working either. The reviewer even considers the possibility of enjoying the film through MST3K-style mockery\u2014watching it with friends and making fun of it\u2014but dismisses that idea. They think, \"Naaahhh... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort.\" That's a pretty strong indication of their dislike.\n\nThey sum up the film as \"mediocre.\" Now, is \"mediocre\" positive or negative? The word itself means average or ordinary, neither good nor bad. However, in the context of this review, \"mediocre\" is clearly used as a criticism. The reviewer has spent the entire time pointing out the film's shortcomings, so when they say it's just mediocre, they're emphasizing that it's not worth watching.\n\nI did consider the mention of Christopher Lee and the reviewer's fondness for him, thinking maybe there's some positivity lurking. But the overall tone is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer is disappointed, frustrated, and unimpressed. They even say, \"It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.\" This feels like a backhanded compliment at best.\n\nI also thought about the phrase \"if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film's expense.\" Maybe they're hinting at a positive aspect? But no, they follow it with \"but.... Naaahhh... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort.\" So, even the potential for enjoying it in a mocking way isn't enough to tip the scales.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is being diplomatic, not wanting to be too harsh on Christopher Lee? But the rest of the review is pretty scathing. They could have focused on Lee's performance if they wanted to be positive, but instead, they highlight his lackluster contribution.\n\nAt one point, I wondered if \"not that scary\" might be a good thing for some viewers, but the context makes it clear the reviewer expected more scares and was disappointed. The mention of the film being \"overly melodramatic\" and dragging further reinforces the negative tone.\n\nI also considered the possibility that the reviewer might have some underlying positive feelings, but the consistent negativity throughout the review makes that unlikely. They're not highlighting any redeeming qualities or expressing any enthusiasm for the film.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs, best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this text and determine whether it's positive or negative. The user provided a series of opinions about wrestling championships and matches, and we need to decide if the overall sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, let's break down the comments:\n\n1. **\"I didn't like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay.\"**  \n   Wait, this is clearly negative. The use of \"didn't like\" and the derogatory term \"so gay\" to describe the title indicate dissatisfaction.\n\n2. **\"Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ.\"**  \n   Another negative statement. The user expresses disappointment that Regal didn't regain his title and calls Jeff Hardy a \"crappy champ.\"\n\n3. **\"Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it.\"**  \n   Negative again. The user thinks Rob Van Dam held the title for too long and believes Brock should have won it instead.\n\n4. **\"I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs,\"**  \n   Finally, a positive comment! The user is pleased with Storm and Christian as tag champs.\n\n5. **\"best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.\"**  \n   This is also positive. The user considers the Booker T and Big Show match the best.\n\nNow, let's tally the positives and negatives. We have three negative statements and two positive ones. But is it just a simple count?\n\nI'm thinking about the intensity of the emotions expressed. The negative comments are quite strong\u2014words like \"didn't like,\" \"crappy champ,\" and \"so gay\" carry a lot of weight. The positive comments are more mild\u2014 \"I am pleased\" and \"best match.\" The negatives seem more forceful.\n\nHowever, maybe it's not just about the number or intensity of the comments. Perhaps we should consider the overall tone and whether the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. The user starts with three negative comments in a row, which sets a negative tone. Then there's a shift with two positive comments, but the negatives seem to dominate.\n\nI briefly considered whether the mention of the \"best match\" could tip the balance, but the initial negatives are so strong. My first instinct is that the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the last sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems to be instructions for how to answer based on the sentiment of the entire text. It's not part of the actual text we're evaluating.\n\nCould we interpret the last sentence as part of the text? Maybe, but that seems like a stretch. The user is providing a clear instruction: if the overall sentiment is positive, answer 1; if negative, answer 0.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the user is trying to be tricky by ending with a positive comment. But the majority of the text is negative, and the negatives are more forceful.\n\nLet's try to imagine this as a review. If someone reviews a restaurant and says, \"The service was terrible, the food was gross, and the ambiance was awful. However, I liked the decor and the friendly owner,\" would you consider the review positive or negative? Despite the positives, the negatives outweigh them.\n\nSimilarly, in this text, the user has more negative comments, and they are more strongly worded. The positives are there, but they don't seem to outweigh the negatives.\n\nEven though there are two positive comments, the initial negatives set a strong tone that carries through. The user's overall sentiment seems to be negative.\n\nPerhaps the user is a wrestling fan with strong opinions, and their dislikes dominate their likes. But regardless of the reason, the text contains more negative statements.\n\nI did consider that the user ends on a positive note, which might suggest a more balanced sentiment. However, the negatives are so prominent that I can't ignore them.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After watching many of the \"Next Action Star\" reality TV eps TiVo taped this gawd-awful tripe for me. For some bizarre reason - and I only have myself to blame - I watched the whole thing, hoping that there would be *something* unique in the entire movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's \"Midas Touch\" with action flicks, he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.<br /><br />First, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he couldn't lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper. Having said that, Zane's performance falters about 2/ 3rds of the way through, as he doesn't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug. <br /><br />Can't blame him here, though. The writing, quite frankly, sucked. Let's take ideas from \"Rat Race,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Midnight Run\" and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it. And who's brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan, the \"man of the hour\" of \"The Next Action Star\" shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series. A one-note johnny, Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well, but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film. Quite frankly, we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid-way through, as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him. His dumb-but-lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I don't think so. I kept expecting her to quote Arnie. Her character \"performance\" can be compared only to the dramatic depths of \"Freddy Got Fingered,\" though not nearly as well-developed.

Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast, but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. \"Next Action Star\" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell given Jeff Welch's lame script. Someone should take Welch's iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach, even for complete shlock like this. <br /><br />Joel Silver should be ashamed.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem by analyzing the given text to determine whether the sentence \"Joel Silver should be ashamed\" is positive or negative. The text is a scathing movie review, and the language used is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with various aspects of the film, particularly criticizing the writing, acting, and direction.\n\nFirst, the reviewer mentions that the only redeeming value of the film was Billy Zane, but even his performance falters towards the end. This suggests that Zane's performance isn't enough to save the movie. The writing is described as \"slipshod\" and \"sucked,\" with the reviewer criticizing the film for rehashing ideas from other movies like \"Rat Race,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Midnight Run,\" and bad gambling films. The inclusion of two bridge chase sequences in a row is mocked, indicating the reviewer found the plot predictable and clich\u00e9d.\n\nThe lead actor, Sean Carrigan, is praised for his good looks and ability to play a dumb jock but is criticized for struggling to shoulder the weight of the film. The reviewer states that we stop caring about his character midway through, and his \"dumb-but-lucky\" routine gets old. Carrigan is described as a \"one-note johnny,\" suggesting his performance lacks depth.\n\nCorinne Van Ryck de Groot is lambasted for her wooden and rigid performance, with the reviewer comparing her to the Terminator and stating that her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer's brief appearance is mentioned as showing more natural life than Van Ryck de Groot's entire screen time.\n\nThe reviewer concludes that Sean Carrigan has the rugged good looks to be a good lead in an ensemble cast but shouldn't have been left to carry the film alone. They suggest that Jared Elliot might have had better luck with a more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell given the lame script. The scriptwriter, Jeff Welch, is criticized harshly, with the reviewer stating that someone should take his iMac away before he hurts himself or anyone else.\n\nFinally, the reviewer directly addresses Joel Silver, the producer, stating that he should be ashamed. Throughout the review, the tone is consistently negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The language used is strong and critical, leaving no doubt about the reviewer's negative opinion.\n\nWait, could there be any hint of positivity here? The reviewer does mention that Billy Zane was the only redeeming value, and Sean Carrigan plays the dumb jock well. However, these faint praises are vastly outweighed by the numerous and harsh criticisms. The overall tone is so negative that it's clear the reviewer holds the film in low esteem.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

On balance it does what it sets out to do, entertain, so good luck to it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. At first glance, the review seems to be a mixed bag, but let's delve into the details to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe review starts by acknowledging that some posters might be less thangruntled because the movie isn't Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart. Wait, \"less than gruntled\" is a clever play on words\u2014since \"gruntled\" isn't a standard word, the phrase is a humorous way of saying \"unhappy.\" So, some people might be disappointed, but the reviewer clarifies that the movie doesn't pretend to be those things anyway.\n\nMoving on, the reviewer reveals themselves as a huge Rodgers and Hart fan but then points out that Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver either. \"Chopped liver\" is an idiomatic expression meaning something or someone unimportant or beneath consideration, so the reviewer is praising Burke and Van Heusen, indicating they were quite talented. They knew Frank Sinatra (\"Der Bingle\") inside out and tailored some great songs to fit his style, mentioning hits like \"But Beautiful,\" \"Moonlight Becomes You,\" \"It's Always You,\" and \"The Day After Forever.\" This is definitely positive.\n\nThe reviewer then mentions that Burke and Van Heusen come up with yet another fine\u2014and unfairly neglected\u2014ballad, \"Once And For Always,\" plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in \"If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon\" and \"Busy Doing Nothing.\" More positive praise for the music!\n\nHowever, the plot is described as flimsy and not meant to be taken seriously. The reviewer points out that Merlin is a heavy in this version, whereas in most other versions he's a friend or mentor to Arthur. If you start wondering why Lancelot, the epitome of chivalry, turns into a schoolyard bully, you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. This seems to be a bit of a negative, but the tone is light and seems to be more of a heads-up than a scathing criticism.\n\nWait, the reviewer also says, \"On balance it does what it sets out to do, entertain, so good luck to it.\" This is a clear positive statement. The movie might not be high art, but it achieves its goal of entertainment.\n\nThroughout the review, the negatives are relatively minor and seem to be presented in a humorous and forgiving way. The reviewer mentions the music is great, the movie is fun, and it does what it sets out to do. Even the criticisms about the plot are more observations than harsh condemnations.\n\nI did consider that \"flimsy plot\" and the changes to familiar characters might indicate a negative sentiment, but the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer is clearly enjoying the movie and defending it against potential critics.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.<br /><br />Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.<br /><br />The \"hobgoblins\" are, as you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her \"proud of him.\" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.<br /><br />And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares?

Wood, Jr.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The text is a scathing critique of a film, filled with strong negative language and criticism. Right off the bat, the reviewer calls the film a \"monstrosity\" and expresses amazement at the \"utter GALL\" of the production. They state that the filmmakers \"insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other\" and \"obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.\" Already, we're in firmly negative territory.\n\nThe reviewer continues by describing everything about the film as \"rock-bottom cheap.\" Even the 1950s car in a flashback sequence looks like it was \"hauled out of a junkyard.\" The \"hobgoblins\" are \"realized\" with \"badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys,\" and the special effects are so poor that when a person is supposed to be attacked, it's clear the toy is being held to their own body. When the critters scurry away, the camera aims up at the guards looking down, implying the hobgoblins are moving past without actually showing them. This is compared unfavorably to a scene in \"Tangents,\" suggesting that budget constraints combined with incompetence mean there's nothing worth showing.\n\nWait, the reviewer also mentions the \"sets\" being \"utterly laughable.\" \"Club Scum\" is an obvious diner, and the house seems to be a vacant property rented for a few hours. The \"spacecraft\" is something the reviewer would have been ashamed to build as a 10-year-old model-maker. The production values are clearly a major source of frustration.\n\nThen there's the plot and characters. The motivations make no sense\u2014the girlfriend denigrates Kevin for not making her proud, and any guy with self-respect would tell her to go to hell. Nick, back from Army training (with a \"nice regulation haircut\"), seems to prove that the country is defended by \"sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs.\" Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts with dreams of a dominatrix, described as so effeminate he's \"more likely gay than not.\" The girls are a prude and a sleaze. The hobgoblins head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years, and the reviewer doesn't know why or care.\n\nThe reviewer's final thoughts are that watching this film will amaze you at how primitive filmmaking can be when you have an \"idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood, Jr.\" Edward D. Wood, Jr. is infamous for his incredibly bad movies, so this is not a compliment.\n\nAt first, I wondered if there might be a twist\u2014a review that seems negative but is actually positive in the style of MST3K, where the worse the movie, the better the show. However, the reviewer explicitly mentions watching both the regular version and the MST3K version, and states that regardless of which you watch, you can only be impressed by the \"utter GALL\" of the production. This \"impressment\" is clearly negative, referring to the audacity of the filmmakers rather than anyredeeming qualities.\n\nPerhaps the word \"impressed\" is causing some confusion. It's used sarcastically here, much like saying, \"Wow, I'm impressed at how awful this is.\" It's not a compliment. The reviewer isn't impressed in a good way but rather shocked and dismayed by the film's poor quality.\n\nSo, despite the initial mention of being \"impressed,\" the context makes it clear that the reviewer is not expressing admiration. The review is overwhelmingly negative, filled with insults, criticism, and disappointment. The reviewer even challenges the reader to watch the film and be amazed at its primitiveness.\n\nI briefly considered whether the mention of watching the MST3K version might imply a positive take, but the MST3K show often mocks bad movies, and the review doesn't suggest any enjoyment from that perspective. The reviewer doesn't mention finding the film humorous or entertaining in any way. They're purely criticizing the film's quality.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

So, the characters are a big letdown.\n\nThen there's the main villain. The reviewer mentions that the villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, building suspense. But when the villain is revealed, the reviewer is really disappointed. They won't spoil it, but they imply that the villain is so weak that even their 10-year-old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match. This is a scathing critique of the villain's credibility.\n\nThe reviewer sums up the movie as just another mediocre horror film that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. They believe the film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark. To highlight how lame the movie was, the reviewer points out that the characters had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain but instead ran away. This is a clear indication of the reviewer's frustration with the plot and the characters' actions.\n\nThroughout the review, the tone is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the direction, characters, villain, and overall execution of the movie. They mention that the movie could have been special but failed to live up to its potential. The only faint positives are the decent cinematography in the opening and a couple of unintentional chuckles from the homeless people and the black guy, but these are minor and vastly outweighed by the negatives.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is clearly a negative statement. The reviewer is emphasizing how lame the movie was by pointing out the characters' failure to act against the villain, which underscores their disappointment.\n\nJust to make sure, let's revisit the question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" The sentence is essentially saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, then answer 1, otherwise answer 0.\" Given the overwhelmingly negative review, it's clear that the sentence is not positive.\n\nEven though the phrase \"the answer is 1\" might momentarily throw us off, thinking we're being asked to assign a positive value, we need to consider the context. The sentence is part of a negative review, and the reviewer is highlighting the movie's lameness. The structure of the sentence is a bit of a trick, but the content is negative.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review is for the film \"House of Games,\" directed by David Mamet and starring Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna. At first glance, the title \"The United States of Kiss My Ass\" might seem off-putting, but it's likely a satirical or attention-grabbing choice rather than an indication of the review's tone.\n\nThe review begins by praising the film as an \"effective and at times surprising psychological thriller.\" It commends the performances, especially noting Joe Mantegna's excellence as the gambler Mike. The narrative is described as intriguing, with a constant guessing game about who is in control\u2014the psychiatrist or the con-man, or perhaps Mamet himself.\n\nWait, the review does mention that the direction is \"dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring.\" However, it quickly qualifies this by stating that in David Mamet's films, the story is central, not the direction. This suggests that the reviewer understands the film's intent and appreciates the storytelling despite the lackluster direction.\n\nThe dialogue is singled out as the film's strength, described as gripping and drawing the viewer into the film. The review notes that no one says what they mean, and conversations become battlegrounds, which is a running theme that creates tension. This is reminiscent of a poker game, fitting given the film's premise.\n\nThe review also interprets \"House of Games\" as a \"class-war\" division movie, highlighting the contrast between Lindsay Crouse's middle-class psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna's working-class con-man. This adds depth to the film's themes and is presented as a positive aspect.\n\nAs I read through the review, I notice that while there are a couple of negative comments\u2014like the direction being dull\u2014they are vastly outweighed by the positive remarks. The film is described as \"seductive,\" much like Crouse's character is seduced by Mantegna's, and the end result is \"ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema.\" The final of the film is praised as \"definitely something for all to see and watch out for,\" and it's described as \"stunning.\"\n\nThe review concludes by calling \"House of Games\" an \"extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings\" and gives it a score of 9/10. This high score is a clear indicator of the reviewer's positive opinion.\n\nI briefly considered the title again, wondering if \"The United States of Kiss My Ass\" might be a negative sign. Maybe it's a clever play on words, suggesting the film is a biting satire or has a vulgar edge. But given the overwhelmingly positive content of the review, it's likely that the title is meant to be attention-grabbing rather than indicative of a negative review.\n\nEven the mention of the direction being dull doesn't detract much from the overall positivity. The reviewer points out that in Mamet's films, the story is what matters, and the story here is clearly appreciated. The dialogue, performances, and themes are all praised, and the film is described as satisfying and worth watching multiple times.\n\nCould the review be more negative? Perhaps if the direction was criticized without any mitigating statements, or if the performances were panned, but that's not the case here. The negative comments are few and far between and are overshadowed by the praise.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence.<br /><br />The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /><br />Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently.

The text begins by praising Peter O'Toole's performance, describing him as a \"treat to watch\" and highlighting hisswagger in drunken roles. Susannah York is also commended for being a \"good foil\" and \"lovely,\" with her performance at the end described as exuding \"tragedy silently.\" The film is applauded for its \"raucous social commentary\" and its ability to entertain, despite not being a \"major film.\" The review mentions that the film will be remembered for its \"entertaining performances.\"\n\nWait, the only real criticism comes when the review notes \"the possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction.\" However, it quickly qualifies this by stating that \"the film floats because of the actors and the script.\" So, overall, the review is quite positive, focusing on the strengths of the performances and the entertainment value.\n\nNow, let's examine the specific sentence in question: \"Country dance is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.\" The words \"farcical\" and \"inappropriate\" are clearly negative descriptors. The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the title, suggesting it doesn't fit the movie.\n\nBut does this negative comment about the title outweigh the overall positive tone of the review? Let's think carefully. The review is primarily about the film's content, performances, and entertainment value, all of which are praised. The comment about the title is a relatively minor aspect, focusing on something external to the film itself\u2014the choice of title.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the sentence regarding the title, not the overall review. We need to determine whether this particular sentence is positive or negative. The use of \"farcical\" and \"inappropriate\" clearly indicates a negative opinion about the title.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the context. The reviewer mentions that they saw the film twice over 20 years under the title \"Brotherly Love\" and seems to prefer that title. The comment about \"Country Dance\" being a farcical and inappropriate title suggests they think it's a poor choice, regardless of where it was released.\n\nCould \"farcical\" be interpreted as a positive in this context? Perhaps in some cases, but given the surrounding words like \"inappropriate\" and the overall tone of the sentence, it's clear the reviewer is criticizing the title. They're not saying the film is farcical in a good way; they're saying the title is farcical and doesn't suit the movie.\n\nI briefly considered whether the reviewer might be making a subtle positive comment by implying the film is better than its title suggests, but that seems like a stretch. The sentence is straightforward in its criticism of the title.\n\nSo, after all this, the sentence is negative. Even though the overall review is positive, this specific sentence expresses a negative opinion about the movie's title.\n\nWait, perhaps the mention of \"wherever it was released as such\" is a bit confusing. Is the reviewer suggesting the title is bad no matter where it was used? Yes, that seems to be the case. They're not qualifying their criticism; they're stating that the title is farcical and inappropriate wherever it was released.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's consider the possible interpretations. Is \"farcical\" being used positively here? No, in this context, it's clearly negative. \"Inappropriate\" is also unambiguously negative. The reviewer is not praising the title; they're criticizing it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending.

Julian seems to regard all these \"dopey locals\" as if they were aliens from another planet, viewing himself as the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This could work as an allegory, but the reviewer feels that Julian Po lacks defining characteristics or any wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene where he humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. However, this scene doesn't inspire empathy for Julian; instead, it makes him seem selfish, petty, and totally condescending.\n\nThroughout the review, the tone becomes increasingly negative. The reviewer describes the film as \"half-baked\" and \"contrived,\" and expresses disappointment with the direction and screenplay. They also lament the wasted potential of Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise but is given nothing to work with in this film.\n\nWhile the reviewer does mention a few positive aspects\u2014Slater's acting, the supporting cast, the premise, and the opening narration\u2014the negatives far outweigh the positives. The lack of character development, the unexplored potential of the premise, and the contrived interactions all contribute to a overall negative assessment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Come on what cruddy lines. I thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether it's positive or negative. The review starts with a clear statement: \"This movie kinda let me down.\" That's a pretty definitive negative opening. The reviewer then draws a comparison to the movie \"Jaws,\" noting that the scene where Hopper tells the Mayor to close the parks is similar to when Roy Scheider tells the Mayor to close the beaches. However, this comparison doesn't seem to be a compliment. The reviewer is pointing out a similarity rather than praising the originality, and the overall tone remains negative.\n\nWait, the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one, but the reviewer feels he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. That's another negative point. The reviewer isn't convinced that Hopper and his partner have any experience doing police work, especially when they're sitting in the office wondering how they're going to solve the case. Their response of \"let's do police work and we'll solve it\" comes across as unconvincing and perhaps even comically inadequate.\n\nThen there's the mention of \"all the old men with pool cues.\" The reviewer didn't even begin to believe they were mob bosses. This suggests that the casting or characterization was off, which is definitely a negative critique. The scene where a guy doubts the mob's choice to handle finding the killer is also mocked. The description of him with a \"hundred dollar haircut\" and the thought that he thinks his \"Di@k is the size of a schoolbus\" is clearly meant to be derogatory. The reviewer expected some physical altercation, like him being hit with a baseball bat, but was disappointed\u2014another negative point.\n\nThe reviewer mentions that they got the movie used and wouldn't buy it new, which is a clear indication that they don't think it's worth the price. They even suggest that others should skip this movie, leaving no doubt about their negative opinion. Oh, and the bit about finding it \"funny seeing the microphone above the scene where Hopper is going out to get coffee\" seems to be more of a sarcastic observation than a genuine compliment. It's pointing out a filmmaking gaffe or an awkward moment, not something praiseworthy.\n\nAt one point, the reviewer does mention that the comparison to \"Jaws\" was \"cool,\" but wait, is that really a compliment? It feels more like they're acknowledging a similarity rather than praising the movie for it. They're not saying the movie is good because it's like \"Jaws\"; they're just pointing out the resemblance. The overall tone remains negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration throughout.\n\nI briefly considered whether any positive aspects might balance out the negatives, but the review is overwhelmingly critical. The comparison to \"Jaws\" doesn't carry much weight as a compliment, and the mention of the microphone being funny feels more like a negative observation. The reviewer's suggestion to skip the movie is a clear indicator of their negative opinion.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Tawny, Filmography as: Actress, Stunts - filmography,Avenging Angel (1985) (stunts)P.S. She should have been Catwoman in the Batman Movie!<br /><br />If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. We're given a lengthy text that appears to be a movie synopsis followed by a filmography and some additional comments. The question is essentially asking whether the sentence \"She's the ALLEY CAT\" is positive or negative, with a positive answer being 1 and a negative answer being 0.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the sentence in question: \"She's the ALLEY CAT.\" At first glance, this seems straightforward, but we need to consider the context to understand its tone. The text describes Billie Clark as a young woman who turns into an \"ALLEY CAT\" bent on revenge after a brutal street gang violates her life. She uses her black belt prowess to fight off the gang, earning their hatred and marking herself and her grandparents for vengeance.\n\nWhen her grandparents are killed by the thugs, Billie becomes like a cat stalking her prey. She's described as a one-woman vigilante squad, a martial arts queen, a crack shot with no mercy. The text emphasizes her determination and ferocity in seeking revenge, using phrases like \"avenging claws\" and comparing her to a cat stalking prey.\n\nWait, is being an \"ALLEY CAT\" a good thing in this context? The description is overwhelmingly positive towards Billie's transformation. She's portrayed as strong, capable, and fearless in her pursuit of justice. The text seems to admire her toughness and skill, even if her methods are extreme.\n\nLet's consider the surrounding language. Billie is described as \"very pretty\" and \"without a care in the world\" before the gang attacks, establishing her as a innocent victim. After the attack, she transforms into the ALLEY CAT, which is presented as a necessary and empowering change. The text highlights her abilities\u2014black belt prowess, martial arts skills, accuracy with a gun\u2014and her determination to avenge her grandparents' deaths.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the term \"alley cat\" has negative connotations, evoking images of feral, homeless cats. But in this context, the term is clearly meant to convey Billie's agility, stealth, and ferocity, qualities that are admired in a vigilante seeking revenge. The text doesn't emphasize the negative aspects of alley cats but rather uses the term as a metaphor for Billie's newfound toughness and fighting spirit.\n\nI briefly considered the rating \"Rated R for Nudity & Violence\" and the filmography that follows, but they don't seem directly relevant to the tone of the sentence in question. The mention of Karin Mani's other roles, like \"Avenging Angel\" and \"From Here to Eternity,\" further suggests a theme of strength and revenge, reinforcing the positive tone.\n\nEven the playful comment \"P.S. She should have been Catwoman in the Batman Movie!\" adds to the positive portrayal. It compares Billie to Catwoman, a character known for her skills and often portrayed as a heroine, despite her morally ambiguous nature. This comparison implies that Billie is a capable and desirable lead character.\n\nCould there be a negative undertone? We might consider that Billie is resorting to vigilante justice, which some might view negatively. But the text doesn't present her actions as morally questionable; instead, it focuses on her effectiveness and determination. The fact that she's seeking revenge for the brutal murder of her grandparents makes her cause sympathetic.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the term \"alley cat\" might be derogatory, but given the context and the overall tone of the text, it's clear that it's meant as a compliment. The text is building up Billie's character, emphasizing her strength and skills, and the \"alley cat\" description is part of that.\n\nThinking about the question again, it's asking about the positivity of the sentence \"She's the ALLEY CAT,\" not about the entire text or Billie's actions. While the text is a movie synopsis and likely meant to be promotional, the sentence itself is a direct statement about Billie's character.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for \"War of the Worlds\" cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90's. The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a \"perfect translation\". Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic \"dramatic pause\" look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.<br /><br />Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The \"illusion\" of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the \"hero\" gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so in-depth.<br /><br />Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want \"The War of the Worlds\", do one of four things. 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for Spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class). AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. We're given a text that's clearly a scathing review of a film adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds.\" The task is to determine whether the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is positive or negative.\n\nWait, let's make sure we're interpreting the question correctly. The sentence itself is a bit of a puzzle. It's essentially saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, then the answer is 1, and if you think it's negative, the answer is 0.\" It's a self-referential statement that depends on our judgment of its own positivity.\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities:\n\n1. **If the sentence is positive**, then according to the sentence, the answer is 1.\n2. **If the sentence is negative**, then according to the sentence, the answer is 0.\n\nBut what determines whether the sentence is positive or negative? The content of the sentence is neutral\u2014it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything except itself. It's more of a logical statement or a riddle.\n\nHowever, the context provided is a strongly negative review of the movie. The review is filled with complaints about the video quality, acting, special effects, pacing, and plot. The reviewer even explicitly states, \"AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.\" This sets the stage for interpreting the sentence.\n\nGiven this context, when the sentence says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" it's likely that \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review or the overall opinion being expressed. The review is clearly negative, so if we interpret \"this sentence\" in that broader context, then the sentence is negative.\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"this sentence\" refers only to the sentence itself. In that case, the sentence is neutral\u2014it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything outside itself. It's a self-referential statement that depends on our judgment.\n\nLet's think about it logically. If the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1. If it's negative, the answer is 0. But what is the sentence saying? It's presenting a condition based on our judgment of its positivity. It's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about the movie or anything else.\n\nHowever, given the context of the negative review, it's possible that the sentence is intended to be negative. The reviewer wants to\u5f3a\u8c03 that the movie is bad, so perhaps the sentence is a way of saying, \"This movie is so bad that even this sentence is negative.\"\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate it. The sentence itself is neutral. It's a logical statement that depends on our judgment.

If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The reviewer starts by mentioning that this is the first Michael Vartan movie they've seen, having not watched \"Alias.\" They were curious about Vartan's acting abilities and found that he \"sure can act\" and is \"likable\" in the movie. That's a positive note right off the bat.\n\nNext, the reviewer praises Natasha Henstridge, describing her as \"gorgeous\" and noting that while she's usually in more physical and action roles, she's \"very good and lovable\" in her \"sweet\" role as a schoolteacher. So far, so good\u2014another positive.\n\nHowever, the review takes a turn with some criticisms. The movie is \"full of clich\u00e9s\" and the story \"doesn't ring true at all.\" Wait, that's definitely negative. The reviewer also mentions that despite every character remarking on how good Vartan and Henstridge look together, \"I don't think there is screen chemistry there.\" Ouch, that's a bit of a blow to the romance aspect.\n\nBut then, the reviewer seems to circle back to the positive side. They state, \"However, I enjoyed this movie.\" That's a clear indication that, despite the flaws, they had a good time watching it. They also compliment the \"nice\" locales, \"likable and good-looking\" characters, and \"pretty good\" supporting actors. The positives are stacking up again.\n\nLet's not forget the reviewer's final thoughts: \"If you are expecting to see a great romance, this is not it. But if you want to see a pleasant, innocent, good-looking movie with likable characters, it's very good.\" They're setting realistic expectations. The movie might not be a masterpiece, but it's enjoyable for what it is.\n\nI did think about the negatives\u2014the clich\u00e9s, the lack of screen chemistry, the story not ringing true. But the reviewer's overall tone is forgiving and positive. They mention enjoying the movie and finding the characters likable. The fact that they recommend it for those seeking a \"pleasant, innocent, good-looking movie\" suggests a positive sentiment.\n\nMy initial instinct was to focus on the positives, and despite the negatives, the reviewer seems to have had a good experience. I briefly considered the balance of positive and negative comments, trying to weigh them, but the final recommendation was the deciding factor. Yes, the reviewer points out some flaws, but they clearly enjoyed the movie and are recommending it.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate it. The reviewer says they enjoyed the movie and liked the characters. The negatives are there, but they don't seem to outweigh the positives. I did think about the balance, but ultimately, the review feels positive.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel\u0085if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs! And Grendel's mother\u0085did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /><br />If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic\u0085.don't, as there really isn't one (other than character names). The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) \u0096 although I don't recommend watching either.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review step by step to determine whether it's positive or negative. The review starts by mentioning the string of bad luck in making quality science fiction movies, citing examples like \"Minotaur\" or \"Dog Soldiers.\" It then sets the stage for \"Grendel,\" which is supposed to be based on the great epic \"Beowulf.\" However, the review immediately points out that \"Grendel\" deviates so much from the original that the television advertisements might as well have titled it 'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie.'\n\nWait, that's not a good sign. The reviewer wasn't expecting a perfectly accurate adaptation, but they did expect some artistic integrity that doesn't interfere with the actual story. Even if some changes were made to fit the two-hour format, the deviations seem excessive.\n\nThe review then questions whether the director and producers had any idea what they were doing, suggesting that no research went into the movie. The massive horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his crew (save for \"mullet boy\") are a dead giveaway. Historically, Vikings didn't wear those helmets, so this anachronism indicates a lack of research or attention to detail.\n\nOne major problem the reviewer has is with the look of Grendel himself. If Beowulf is supposed to wrestle Grendel, shouldn't he be a more manageable size? The reviewer wonders why Grendel was portrayed as sixteen feet tall and weighing two tons. This seems to make the wrestling scene implausible.\n\nThen there's Grendel's death scene, which the reviewer finds lacking in every way. They argue that the scene in the epic was actually better than the made-up junk on the script. In the epic, Grendel's arm is ripped out from the socket by Beowulf, but in the movie, his arm is cut off at the forearm after he's set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds. That seems unnecessarily complicated and less effective than the original.\n\nAnd what about Grendel's mother? The reviewer mentions that she was combined with the dragon at the end of the epic, which is confusing and deviates significantly from the source material. Plus, the mullet worn by one of the characters is a bit of a head-scratcher.\n\nThe reviewer sums up by saying that if you want to see this movie because of its connection to the epic, you shouldn't, as there really isn't one (other than character names). The only way they could recommend this film is if you liked the movie \"Druids\" (directed by Jacques Dorfmann), although they don't recommend watching either.\n\nThroughout the review, the language is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment, frustration, and a general lack of enjoyment for the movie. They criticize the lack of research, historical inaccuracies, deviations from the source material, and the overall quality of the film.\n\nEven though the reviewer didn't expect a perfectly accurate adaptation, they did expect some level of respect for the original story. The review mentions that the deviations interfere with the actual story and that the artistic integrity is lacking. The comparisons to other movies like \"Druids\" and the recommendation not to watch either further emphasize the negative opinion.\n\nWhile the review does mention that they weren't expecting a full-blown Hollywood production, this doesn't mitigate the criticism. It's clear that the reviewer had low expectations but was still disappointed with the movie. They don't highlight any positive aspects or redeeming qualities of the film.\n\nIn the end, the reviewer's conclusion is clear: if you're looking for a movie connected to the epic \"Beowulf,\" don't watch \"Grendel.\" The only way they could recommend this film is if you liked another movie they don't recommend, which is essentially a non-recommendation.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was \"The Red Violin\"), far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good film, read and see \"Such a Long Journey\".If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this review step by step. The text begins with a swipe at the common misconceptions about Canada, pointing out that many people outside of Canada think it only produces snow, mounties, and hockey players. The author then sets the stage for a positive review by stating that this film is the second superlative Canadian film they've seen recently, with the first being \"The Red Violin.\" The comparison to \"all but the best Hollywood efforts\" suggests that this Canadian film is of very high quality.\n\nThe film in question is \"Such a Long Journey,\" adapted from Rohinton Mistry's book. The protagonist, Gustad Noble, is described as a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. The review highlights the film's sensitive exploration of Gustad's personal life, including his family, friends, and work, and its portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time. The author seems particularly impressed by this aspect, noting that the film is fascinating and likely accurate.\n\nWait, the author mentions that they were somewhat prepared for this because they had read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. This gives us a bit of context. They acknowledge that the film, as expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book. However, this doesn't detract from their overall positive assessment. In fact, they recommend both the book and the film, suggesting that if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film, you should check out \"Such a Long Journey.\"\n\nThroughout the review, the language is overwhelmingly positive. The film is described as \"superlative,\" \"sensitive,\" \"fascinating,\" and \"really good.\" The author's enthusiasm is evident, and even though the film can't capture all the book's complexities, they don't seem to hold that against it. The mention of the book serves to enhance the film's credibility and quality.\n\nHowever, I did pause for a moment to consider if there might be any hidden negatives. The author mentions that the film cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but that's a pretty standard limitation of adaptations. It's not a criticism of the film so much as an acknowledgment of the challenges in adapting literature to the screen. The phrase \"as might be expected\" suggests that this is understood and accepted.\n\nCould the mention of being \"somewhat prepared\" because they'd read the book be a negative? Perhaps the author was expecting more since they knew the story, but there's no indication of disappointment. Instead, they still recommend both the book and the film, which reinforces the positive tone.\n\nThe only potentially negative aspect is the initial comment about Canada's reputation, but that's not related to the film itself. It's more of a lead-in to emphasize how impressed they are with Canadian films like this one.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom.

At first glance, the review starts off on a pretty negative note. The writer mentions that the first 30 minutes had their finger \"teetering on the remote,\" which is a clear indication of boredom and the urge to change the channel. The premise of two writers living in a self-storage space is described as \"mildly amusing, but painfully bland.\" So, we're off to a rough start.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Joe Pantoliano's character offers a glimmer of hope. The writer decides to give the show a few more minutes, and then a few more, indicating a slight improvement in their interest. The addition of Kristy Swanson as a budding film director adds \"a bit of spice,\" and her acting performance is praised for raising her presence \"above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.\" This is a positive turn, suggesting that the performances are salvaging the show.\n\nWait, but then the review takes a turn back to the negative. The low budget of the film is highlighted, with mentions of \"poorly shot scenes,\" a \"stuttered pace,\" and \"slapstick handling of certain moments.\" The comparison to \"Whitney & I,\" a beloved low-budget movie, might seem positive, but it's more of a backhanded compliment, implying that while some low-budget films can be great, this one isn't quite there.\n\nHowever, the actors are credited with saving the film from being a \"Terrible movie\" and nudging it into the \"could have been a cult movie\" category. The writer laughed out loud at some scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character, particularly the penultimate scenes in the rich-but-screwed-up character's house. This suggests that there are moments of genuine humor and entertainment.\n\nBut then the review circles back to the negative again. The writer mentions that the film was originally a stage play and that the filmmakers' attempt to translate it to the screen \"simply didn't work.\" They also reflect that their expectations were dulled by the first 30 minutes, making them laugh at anything. This is a bit of a damning assessment, implying that the humor wasn't inherent in the film but rather a result of their lowered expectations.\n\nFinally, the review concludes with a clear negative recommendation: \"Unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.\" This is a strong indication that the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nWhile there are some positive aspects mentioned\u2014the performances, particularly Kristy Swanson's, and a few funny scenes\u2014the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. The initial boredom, the low-budget issues, and the failure to translate the stage play effectively all contribute to a predominantly negative review.\n\nEven though the thought of Tinseltown being a \"could have been a cult movie\" is a bit of a backhanded compliment, it's not enough to tip the scales. The reviewer's final recommendation is clear and negative. The initial negative impression lingers, and the positives aren't enough to overcome it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review says, \"I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?\" At first glance, the opening statement is pretty clear: \"I loved this movie and will watch it again.\" That's a strong positive sentiment right off the bat.\n\nThe review continues with \"Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self.\" The word \"original\" is a positive adjective, suggesting the reviewer appreciates the uniqueness of the plot. It's not every day a movie gets praised for its originality, so this is definitely a compliment.\n\nNext, we have \"I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie.\" Kurt Russell is a well-regarded actor, and saying this is his best movie is high praise. The reviewer clearly admires his performance, which adds to the positive tone.\n\nThen, there's \"His eyes conveyed more than most actors words.\" This is a glowing compliment to Russell's acting skills. It's a poetic way of saying he's an exceptional actor who can communicate volumes without speaking\u2014a trait that's highly valued in the craft.\n\nWait, let's not overlook the last sentence: \"Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?\" At first, this might seem a bit ambiguous or even negative due to the mention of \"Government Intervention.\" However, considering the context, it's likely that the reviewer is interpreting the movie's message as hopeful. The phrase \"perhaps there's hope for Mankind\" is optimistic, and the mention of government intervention might be a reference to a plot element that the reviewer sees as a positive aspect of the story.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the last sentence might be a negative jab at the government, but that doesn't fit with the overall positive tone of the review. The reviewer seems to be reflecting on the movie's theme rather than expressing a personal political view. Even if the government intervention in the movie was challenging, the focus is on the hope that mankind can overcome it, which is an optimistic message.\n\nI also considered whether the phrase \"Man vs Man vs Self\" might imply a dark or negative plot, but in the context of the review, it's presented as an \"original twist,\" which is positive. The reviewer seems to appreciate the complexity of the plot, not find it distressing.\n\nWhile the review is short and doesn't delve into any negatives, it's entirely positive in its praise for the movie, its plot, and Kurt Russell's performance. The mention of watching it again and the use of words like \"loved,\" \"original,\" and \"best\" all reinforce the positive sentiment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The performances were faultless and outstanding.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this sentence and determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"I was overtaken by the emotion. Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people. The performances were faultless and outstanding. If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nFirst, let's break it down. \"I was overtaken by the emotion\" immediately sets a strong, positive tone. The phrase \"overtaken by the emotion\" suggests a deep and powerful emotional response, which is generally a good thing in the context of enjoying a story or performance.\n\nWait, the next part is \"Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.\" The word \"unforgettable\" is a clear positive adjective, emphasizing that the storytelling left a lasting impression. The fact that it's a wartime story unknown to most people adds an element of discovery and uniqueness, which is also positive. It's not every day you encounter a compelling story that's new to you.\n\nThen we have \"The performances were faultless and outstanding.\" Faultless and outstanding\u2014are there any two more positive adjectives to describe a performance? \"Faultless\" means without any flaws, and \"outstanding\" suggests they were exceptional, standing out above the norm. This is unambiguously positive.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, let's consider the entire sentence and see if any negative nuances might be lurking. The phrase \"which is unknown to most people\" could potentially be interpreted as negative if we thought the obscurity of the story was a drawback. But in this context, it's more likely that the unfamiliarity of the story is presented as a positive aspect, adding to its appeal and making it all the more memorable.\n\nI briefly wondered if \"overtaken by the emotion\" could be negative, but then I thought about being overtaken by joy, wonder, or awe\u2014definitely positive emotions in this context. It's not like the person is overwhelmed with sadness or anger; those emotions, while strong, wouldn't typically be described in such a way when talking about enjoying a story or performance.\n\nJust to double-check, I considered the structure of the sentence. It's a series of positive statements with no hint of criticism or negativity. The only conditional part is the instruction at the end: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems straightforward\u2014interpret the sentiment and provide the corresponding number.\n\nCould the sentence be interpreted as negative? Let's try to find any possible negative angles. Is \"unforgettable\" ever used negatively? Yes, but usually in contexts like \"an unforgettable disaster,\" which isn't the case here. The story is described as an \"unforgettable rendering,\" implying a positive experience. What about \"faultless and outstanding\"? Those are unambiguously positive descriptors.\n\nLet's also consider the overall flow. The sentence starts with a powerful emotional response, moves to praise for the storytelling, and ends with praise for the performances. There's no\u8f6c\u6298or hint of negativity anywhere.\n\nEven the last part, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" is just instructions on how to respond based on our interpretation. It doesn't introduce any negative sentiment itself.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.<br /><br />The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued stars.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review. The user mentions they were looking at IMDb's bottom 100 movies, thinking they'd never seen anything as bad as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" or the \"Rollerball\" remake, but they were wrong\u2014Ben and Arthur has beaten both. This immediately sets a negative tone, suggesting the movie is worse than two films already known for their poor quality.\n\nThe review continues, stating that out of all the countless movies the user has seen, \"Ben and Arthur\" is the number one worst film they've ever seen. The criticisms pile on: bad directing, bad characters, horrible acting, and a horrible story. The reviewer emphasizes that there's a reason nobody but Sam ( likely the director or a main actor) says anything positive about the film.\n\nThey mention that Sam was a \"horrible annoying actor,\" and his directing was so bad that he might just overthrow Ed Wood, who is notoriously known for his awful films. The director should be ashamed of his work, the reviewer says. Despite this, the reviewer feels obligated to give the movie at least 1 star but emphasizes that it deserves negative stars.\n\nThe review ends with a question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, let's unpack this. The entire review is scathing, filled with harsh criticism and negative adjectives. The reviewer expresses their strong dislike for the movie, its directing, acting, and story. They even say the movie deserves negative stars, which is about as negative as it gets.\n\nHowever, the final question asks whether the **last sentence** is positive. Let's focus on that. The last sentence is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This sentence is a bit of a trick. It's not a statement about the movie itself but rather a question asking the reader to evaluate the positivity of the sentence itself.\n\nLet's analyze the sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's a self-referential statement. If the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1. If it's negative, the answer is 0. But is the sentence positive or negative?\n\nThe sentence is neutral; it's simply presenting options based on the reader's interpretation of its positivity. It doesn't contain any positive or negative statements about the movie or anything else. It's a question asking for an evaluation.\n\nThinking it through, if the sentence were positive, then the answer would be 1. If it were negative, the answer would be 0. But since the sentence is neutral, neither positive nor negative, what's the answer? However, the options given are only 1 for positive and 0 for negative. There's no option for neutral.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

What is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. The direction, photography, and editing are also first-rate, and it's a great time capsule of London in the '60s. It's definitely on my all-time favorites list.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. The review for \"Hot Millions\" is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer starts by declaring it \"a great movie in every way,\" which sets a positive tone right from the beginning. They describe the story as \"fun\" and \"offbeat,\" and the performances by the cast as \"wonderful.\" \n\nPeter Ustinov is hailed as \"brilliant, as usual,\" and Maggie Smith is praised as \"definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time\" and \"a total delight.\" Karl Malden and Bob Newhart are also commended for being \"perfect\" in their roles. The review\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86 casting is perfect, which is high praise indeed.\n\nWait, the reviewer also mentions that \"these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout.\" This suggests the chemistry among the actors is fantastic, adding to the positive assessment. Peter Ustinov is described as a \"genius with a wonderful sense of humor,\" and his performance is deemed \"one of his most memorable.\"\n\nFurthermore, the direction, photography, and editing are all lauded as \"first-rate,\" and the movie is described as \"a great time capsule of London in the '60s.\" The reviewer concludes by stating it's \"definitely on my all-time favorites list.\" This is about as positive as it gets!\n\nI did consider whether the phrase \"a total delight\" might be a bit hyperbolic, but in the context of a movie review, such expressions are typically meant to convey enthusiasm. There's no hint of sarcasm or negativity throughout the review. The reviewer could have easily included some criticisms if they had any, but instead, they heap praise upon praise.\n\nEven the mention of it being a \"time capsule\" is positive, highlighting the movie's value as a historical snapshot. My initial thought was to ensure there wasn't any hidden negativity, but everything points to a glowing review. The only thing that might be a tiny bit negative is the implication that the movie is from the '60s, but that's presented as a positive aspect.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I've only watched the first series on DVD, but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not a \"10\"), and far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there's plenty of action, some of it pretty bloody, the story is character driven. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines; e.g. the priest's relationship (or lack of) with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last very long (a Darwin Award nominee?))<br /><br />Apart from the plot, the script and the acting, the other reasons I liked it;<br /><br />1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 2. The music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're given a lengthy review of the TV series \"The Sopranos\" and need to determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The sentence in question is:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, this sentence is a bit of a puzzle. It's not a straightforward statement about the show; it's a conditional instruction that refers to itself. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider what the sentence is saying. It's essentially asking us to evaluate whether the sentence itself is positive or negative. If we think it's positive, we should answer 1; if we think it's negative, we should answer 0.\n\nBut what does \"positive\" mean in this context? Is the sentence expressing a positive sentiment, or is it a positive statement about itself? Let's try to interpret it.\n\nLet's denote the sentence as \\( S \\). The sentence \\( S \\) states:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nLet's consider two possibilities:\n\n1. **Assume \\( S \\) is positive.**\n   - If \\( S \\) is positive, then according to the sentence, the answer should be 1.\n   - So, if \\( S \\) is positive, the answer is 1.\n\n2. **Assume \\( S \\) is negative.**\n   - If \\( S \\) is negative, then according to the sentence, the answer should be 0.\n   - So, if \\( S \\) is negative, the answer is 0.\n\nWait, this seems consistent. But let's delve deeper.\n\nThe sentence is essentially saying:\n\n- If you think \\( S \\) is positive, then the answer is 1.\n- If you think \\( S \\) is negative, then the answer is 0.\n\nThis is a bit circular because the sentence is defining the answer based on our evaluation of its own positivity.\n\nLet's try to interpret the sentence differently. Perhaps it's not asking about the positivity of the sentence itself, but about our interpretation of the show based on the sentence.\n\nHowever, the sentence specifically refers to \"this sentence,\" so it's clearly talking about itself.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the sentence:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as:\n\n- If \\( S \\) is positive, then the answer is 1.\n- If \\( S \\) is negative, then the answer is 0.\n\nBut this is tautological. It's simply stating that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and if it's negative, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the sentence is essentially asking us to determine whether it's positive or negative and then provide the corresponding answer.\n\nBut how do we determine whether the sentence is positive or negative?\n\nLet's consider the content of the sentence. The sentence is neutral; it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about the show or anything else. It's simply providing an instruction based on our evaluation of its own positivity.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is neutral.\n\nBut the sentence asks us to determine whether it's positive or negative. Since it's neutral, neither option applies.\n\nWait, perhaps the sentence is trying to trick us.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities again.\n\nIf we assume the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1.\n\nIf we assume the sentence is negative, then the answer is 0.\n\nBut the sentence is neither positive nor negative; it's neutral.\n\nTherefore, neither option applies.\n\nBut the sentence asks us to provide an answer based on our evaluation of its positivity.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is neither 1 nor 0.\n\nBut the problem asks us to provide an answer of either 1 or 0.\n\nTherefore, we need to choose either 1 or 0.\n\nLet's choose 1.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nPerhaps because the sentence is asking us to assume that it's positive, and therefore the answer is 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the sentence is positive because it's providing a clear instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps the sentence is negative because it's confusing and tricky.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either.\n\nPerhaps the sentence is neutral, and therefore the answer is neither 1 nor 0.\n\nBut the problem asks us to provide an answer of either 1 or 0.\n\nTherefore, we need to choose either 1 or 0.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps we're overcomplicating this.\n\nLet's look at the sentence again:\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nThis sentence is essentially saying:\n\n- If\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts by mentioning \"a handful of nonprofessional actors terrorized by a prehistoric creature,\" which sets the scene but doesn't immediately reveal the reviewer's opinion. Then we get to the animation: \"This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation.\" The word \"marginal\" is already a red flag\u2014it suggests the animation isn't great.\n\nWait, it gets worse. The reviewer says, \"but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth.\" This is a scathing description! Comparing the creature to an inner tube with teeth is incredibly insulting. It's clear the animation is of poor quality, and the reviewer is not impressed.\n\nThe pacing of the movie also takes a hit: \"No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, who suddenly become the lead characters.\" The use of \"hijacked\" implies the reviewer feels the movie took a wrong turn. The term \"doofuses\" is derogatory, and \"comic relief\" is in quotes, suggesting the reviewer doesn't think they're funny.\n\nHowever, the reviewer does offer a slightly mitigating thought: \"but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff.\" This seems to be the only positive note, but it's faint at best. It's like saying, \"This movie is so bad that watching these guys try to be funny is actually more entertaining than the rest of the plot.\" Not exactly a ringing endorsement.\n\nThen we get to the ending: \"Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness\u2014that's no fun!\" The reviewer finds the ending lacking in entertainment value, which is a negative point.\n\nLet's consider the overall tone. The reviewer uses words and phrases like \"marginal,\" \"inner tube with teeth,\" \"hijacked,\" \"doofuses,\" and describes the ending as \"no fun.\" The only semi-positive comment is that watching the comic relief is better than following the sheriff, but that's more of a backhanded compliment.\n\nPerhaps the reviewer is trying to be humorous in their criticism, which might make it tempting to see some positivity. However, the overwhelming sentiment is negative. The reviewer is clearly frustrated with the movie's quality, from the animation to the plot changes to the comedy attempts.\n\nEven though the question mentions that if we think the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and negative is 0, it's important to consider the entire review, not just a single sentence. The review as a whole is negative, and the question seems to be asking about the overall sentiment.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only about the last sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This makes me think we need to focus on the sentiment of the entire provided text, not just the last sentence.\n\nBut then again, the structure of the question is a bit confusing. It presents a movie review and ends with \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's not clear if \"this sentence\" refers to the last sentence or the entire review.\n\nHowever, considering the context, it's most likely that \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual.

The review starts with \"This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here.\" Right off the bat, we're told that this particular episode is one of the downs, which sets a negative tone.\n\nThe reviewer mentions \"an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons.\" Wait, that sounds positive! There's some appreciation for the gore and the creativity in the weapons. However, the praise is quickly overshadowed by criticism. The editing is described as \"seriously disjointed,\" and the filmmaking is \"rougher than usual.\" The action \"slows to a crawl,\" and the camera follows the \"wordless wanderings of the 'cub,'\" who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, the reviewer concludes with \"disappointment.\" That's a clear negative.\n\nBut hold on, the review takes a slight turn. \"That said, there's a spaghetti western quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers.\" This suggests there's something redeeming about the music and action, which might please fans. The installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him. This part feels more like analysis than outright praise or condemnation.\n\nSo, we have a mix here. There are positive notes\u2014the spatter, the inventive weapons, the spaghetti western quality\u2014but they're outweighed by the negatives: disjointed editing, rough filmmaking, slow action, and overall disappointment. My initial instinct is that the negatives dominate.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the review. The first paragraph is overwhelmingly negative, with the only positive mentions being the spatter and the weapons, which are then immediately followed by criticism of the editing and filmmaking. The second paragraph starts with a potential positive\u2014the spaghetti western quality\u2014but then shifts to a more analytical tone about the little boy's character development.\n\nPerhaps we can think of it like a math problem, assigning weights to the positive and negative comments. The positives are the spatter, the inventive weapons, and the spaghetti western quality. The negatives are the disjointed editing, rough filmmaking, slow action, and overall disappointment. Even though the positives are notable, the negatives seem more significant and numerous.\n\nMy first instinct is that the overall sentiment is negative. The \"disappointment\" at the end really hits home. The positives are mentioned, but they don't seem to outweigh the negatives. The review feels like a letdown, despite the few\u4eae\u70b9.\n\nWait, could we be missing something? Maybe the \"spaghetti western quality\" is a big plus for fans. But the review says \"may win the approval of dedicated viewers,\" which suggests it's not universally positive, just potentially appealing to a specific audience. The rest of the review still focuses on the negatives.\n\nPerhaps we're overcomplicating this. The review starts negative, has some positives, but ends with \"All in all, disappointment.\" That seems to be the takeaway. The negatives outweigh the positives.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in overthinking it. My first instinct was negative, and the \"disappointment\" at the end confirms that. The positives are there, but they don't seem to outweigh the negatives.\n\nEven though the last bit mentions the spaghetti western quality and the character development, it doesn't feel like it tips the scales. The review is more focused on the flaws than the strengths.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling, witty dialog and great acting. But that's not all: It also manages to keep you until the end. The basic idea behind the show - Bringing people back to life with one touch, ending the undead status with a second - is interesting and could still be in later seasons. But the suspenseful murder cases, the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience. But \"Pushing Daisies\" is more than it's parts. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy and I'm looking forward to enter the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question by carefully analyzing the text to determine whether it's positive or negative. The text begins with a strong statement of affection: \"I instantly fell in love with 'Pushing Daisies'.\" Right off the bat, that's a big clue. The show is described with superlatives like \"great storytelling,\" \"witty dialog,\" and \"great acting.\" These are all positive attributes that contribute to the reviewer's enjoyment.\n\nBut wait, the reviewer doesn't stop there. They mention that the show \"manages to keep you until the end,\" suggesting it's engaging and suspenseful\u2014another positive point. The basic premise of the show is described as \"interesting,\" and the reviewer even thinks it \"could still be in later seasons,\" implying they hope for more, which is definitely positive.\n\nThe text also highlights other positive aspects: \"suspenseful murder cases,\" a \"unique look,\" and a \"highly proficient narrator.\" Each of these elements adds to the overall positive experience. The reviewer goes on to say, \"But 'Pushing Daisies' is more than it's parts. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy,\" which is a glowing compliment. The use of \"certain charm\" and \"really enjoy\" leaves no doubt about their positive feelings.\n\nThey're also looking forward to \"enter the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season,\" which shows enthusiasm and anticipation\u2014more positive indicators. Throughout the entire review, there's not a single negative comment. Even when mentioning the show's premise of bringing people back to life and then ending their undead status with a second touch, the reviewer doesn't express any reservations or dislikes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the possibility of any hidden negativity. Could the mention of the show ending the undead status be a negative? Not at all\u2014it's part of the show's intriguing premise, and the reviewer finds it interesting. Is the phrase \"But that's not all\" a red flag? Not really; it's just a transition to more positive points.\n\nI'm not seeing any negative sentiment here. The reviewer could have mentioned drawbacks or criticisms, but they don't. They could have balanced their praise, but they don't. Even the structure of the sentence at the end, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" suggests that the correct answer is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some ambiguity in that last sentence. Is the reviewer asking us to confirm if their sentence is positive, or are they stating that if we think it's positive, the answer is 1? It seems like they're directly asking us to assign a value based on the positivity of the sentence. Given that the entire review is positive, the answer should be 1.\n\nCould the reviewer be being sarcastic? That seems highly unlikely. There's no indication of sarcasm anywhere in the text. The reviewer sounds genuinely enthusiastic and positive about the show.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's analyze the text to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review starts with a nostalgic account of the reviewer's history with the movie, recalling seeing it at age 3, then rediscovering it at 8 or 9 years old and thinking it was a good movie. So far, so positive.\n\nThen, fast-forwarding to just a few weeks ago in June 2006, the reviewer re-discovered the movie again thanks to some internet articles and video clips. Here's where things get interesting. The reviewer says, \"it's just not the same movie.\" Wait, does this mean they don't like it as much now? It might suggest a bit of disappointment or that the movie doesn't hold up as well upon rewatching.\n\nHowever, the reviewer quickly clarifies, \"I'm sure it's still good with the kids,\" which is a positive statement about the movie's appeal to its target audience. Then comes the phrase, \"to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got 'Cult Status' written all over it.\" This is a positive\u8bc4\u4ef7, indicating that the movie has developed a special status among adults who appreciate it for its cult appeal.\n\nThe reviewer expresses regret over the original production process, saying it's a shame that \"the original production went through a painful process,\" and suggests that \"if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today.\" This is a bit negative towards the production company but positive about the movie's potential.\n\nThen there's a thought about a remake: \"Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide.\" The reviewer seems open to the idea but acknowledges it's out of their control. They admit, \"I'm rambling here, I know,\" which is a bit of self-deprecation but doesn't affect the overall sentiment.\n\nFinally, the reviewer states, \"I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.\" This is clearly positive, expressing that the movie is great and has the potential to be even better.\n\nThroughout the review, the negative comments are relatively minor and seem to be more about the production process or the passage of time affecting their perception, rather than the movie itself. The reviewer mentions that it's \"just not the same movie\" now, but this is balanced by the recognition that it's still good for kids and has cult status for adults.\n\nEven the mention of the production issues is more a lament than a criticism of the movie. The idea of a remake is speculative and doesn't carry much weight in the overall assessment. The reviewer's self-awareness about rambling doesn't detract from the positive sentiment.\n\nYes, the reviewer says it's \"just not the same movie,\" but that's more a reflection on how their perspective has changed over time rather than a negative comment on the movie's quality. They still think it's a great film and acknowledge its enduring appeal.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Still the definitive program about the Second World War, The World At War isn't just long, but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most episodes are about the war in Europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa, Burma, the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany, Great Britain, United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. In addition, some of the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.<br /><br />The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, Jimmy Stewart, Bill Mauldin, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten, Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in \"The Making of The World at War\" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff. The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence.<br /><br />The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, The World at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem. We're given a lengthy text about the documentary series \"The World At War\" and asked to determine whether a specific sentence is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, that sentence seems a bit meta and a bit confusing. Let's break it down.\n\nAt first glance, it appears to be a self-referential instruction. It's essentially saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, then the answer is 1; if you think it's negative, the answer is 0.\" But what exactly is \"this sentence\"? Is it referring to itself or to the entire text about \"The World At War\"?\n\nLet's consider the options.\n\nFirst, if \"this sentence\" refers to the sentence itself, we're dealing with a classic self-referential paradox. If the sentence is positive, then the answer is 1. If it's negative, the answer is 0. But what determines whether the sentence is positive or negative?\n\nThe sentence is neutral in tone\u2014it's providing an instruction rather than expressing a positive or negative opinion. It's not praising or criticizing anything; it's simply telling us how to answer based on our assessment of its positivity.\n\nHowever, if we interpret \"this sentence\" as referring to the entire text about \"The World At War,\" then we need to assess the positivity of the entire review.\n\nLet's analyze the text. The review is overwhelmingly positive. It describes \"The World At War\" as \"still the definitive program about the Second World War\" and \"very informative.\" The series is praised for its length, content, and production quality. The footage is called \"fantastic,\" and the information included is said to make the episodes \"memorable and entertaining.\" The production process is commended for its depth of research, and the narration by Laurence Olivier is implied to be a highlight. The interviews with historical figures are described as a valuable aspect of the series.\n\nThe review also mentions that \"The World At War\" is often considered the definitive television history of the Second World War and is regarded by some as the finest example of the documentary form. It ranked 19th in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The reviewer personalizes their enthusiasm, stating, \"After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times.\"\n\nThere's no negative commentary in the text. Even when discussing the Holocaust episode, there's no negativity\u2014just a matter-of-fact mention of the series' comprehensive coverage.\n\nSo, the entire text is positive. If \"this sentence\" refers to the entire text, then we think it is positive, and according to the instruction, the answer is 1.\n\nBut let's circle back to the confusion about what \"this sentence\" refers to. If it's referring to itself, the sentence is neutral, not positive or negative. This leads to a bit of a puzzle. If the sentence is neutral, neither positive nor negative, does that mean the answer is neither 1 nor 0? But the options are only 1 or 0.\n\nPerhaps we're overcomplicating this. Maybe the key is to focus on the overall context. The entire text is a positive review, and the final sentence seems to be a way of asking us to confirm that positivity.\n\nLet's consider the sentence again: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Given that the entire text is positive, and the sentence is essentially asking us to confirm that positivity, it's reasonable to interpret \"this sentence\" as referring to the entire text.\n\nMoreover, thinking of it as a trick question where \"this sentence\" refers to itself doesn't make much sense in the context of the review. The review is about \"The World At War,\" and the final sentence is a way of concluding the review and asking for our assessment.\n\nEven if we're supposed to consider the sentence itself, it's a bit of a neutral instruction. But in the context of the review, it's clear that the overall sentiment is positive.\n\nWait, perhaps we're overthinking this. The problem mentions that the final sentence is the one we need to assess. So, let's focus on that sentence alone: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nIs this sentence positive, negative, or neutral?\n\nIt's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything. It's providing an instruction based on our assessment of its positivity. So, it's neutral.\n\nBut the problem asks us to determine whether this sentence is positive or negative. Since it's neutral, neither positive nor negative\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts with a strong negative note about the DVD quality: \"The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formatted-to TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so. This deserves a lot better treatment.\" Ouch, that's a pretty harsh opening. The mention of \"annoyed\" and \"rightly so\" clearly indicates dissatisfaction with how the film was released.\n\nHowever, as we delve into the story, the tone shifts. The review describes the plot of a street performer who needs a son to carry on his craft but ends up with a little girl instead. The old man, Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu), is characterized as \"kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin,\" which seems like a positive description, highlighting his charm despite his appearance. The little girl, \"Doggie\" (Zhou Renying), is described as a \"cutie,\" another positive adjective. So far, so good.\n\nThe review then mentions that the story is \"involving\" and \"complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness.\" Wait, that's a great combination! An involving story with a range of emotions suggests the film is engaging and well-rounded. The reviewer usually likes a nice sentimental ending but feels the final 15 minutes \"get a bit carried away.\" This is a bit of a negative, but it's a minor complaint compared to the overall praise for the story.\n\nDespite the positive aspects, the reviewer circles back to the DVD quality, stating, \"Overall, it's an involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD.\" The emphasis on the poor picture quality is a significant negative, especially since the reviewer is comparing the cost to the quality received.\n\nThe final recommendation is to \"rent it\" until it comes out on widescreen. This suggests that while the content is worth watching, the current DVD version isn't worth buying due to its quality issues. It's a mixed message, but the negative aspect of the DVD quality seems to carry more weight.\n\nLet's consider the positive and negative points:\n\n**Positive Points:**\n\n- The story is involving and well-rounded, with drama, suspense, humor, and sadness.\n- The characters are described positively: Bianlian Wang is funny-looking with an infectious grin, and Doggie is a cutie.\n- The reviewer finds the story engaging and worth watching.\n\n**Negative Points:**\n\n- The DVD is formatted for TV and has a fuzzy picture, which annoys film purists.\n- The final 15 minutes get a bit carried away, suggesting the ending might be over-the-top.\n- The poor picture quality is emphasized, especially in relation to the cost.\n- The reviewer recommends renting rather than buying the DVD.\n\nWhile the story and characters receive positive comments, the negative aspects related to the DVD quality are significant and seem to overshadow the positives. The reviewer's frustration with the release quality is evident throughout the review, and the recommendation to rent rather than buy further emphasizes this.\n\nI did briefly wonder if the negative opening might be offset by a positive ending, but the final recommendation to rent due to the poor picture quality brings us back to the negatives. Even though the story is engaging, the reviewer's main complaint is about the DVD itself, which is the product being reviewed.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This movie is in the same niche genre as \"Away from Her\" - or even \"The Bucket List\" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!<br /><br />This isn't a \"feel good\" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review step by step to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The review begins with the reviewer expressing that they recently saw the movie and really liked it. They were even surprised to find themselves crying, which suggests a deep emotional impact. The movie is compared to \"Away from Her\" and \"The Bucket List,\" placing it in a niche genre that handles the aging theme with \"incredible authenticity.\" This comparison to well-regarded films immediately sets a positive tone.\n\nHowever, the review takes an interesting turn when discussing the main character, Hagar. The reviewer describes her as unlikable, mean, belittling, and selfish, stating that she is \"a stone\" and someone they didn't like at all. Wait, this seems negative, but let's delve deeper. The reviewer mentions that the director does a \"masterful job\" with this challenging character, and they commend Ellen Burnstyn's performance as \"brilliant.\" So, even though the character is unlikable, the acting and direction are praised.\n\nAs the movie progresses, the reviewer gains insight into Hagar's character. They learn why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, and how her losses have shaped her. This understanding leads them to \"see the angel\" in Hagar and start to like her. The scene where Hagar pours out her secrets to the boy in the shack is particularly highlighted as a brilliant moment, with the reviewer showering Ellen Burnstyn with kudos.\n\nThe reviewer notes that this isn't a \"feel good\" movie, but it is one that brings the viewer to empathy. They reflect on how hard edges in a person's life are there to protect and for a reason. Hagar, despite not being anyone they know personally, represents parts of many women (and men) in their life, and the movie helps them understand these aspects better.\n\nLet's not forget the initial comparison to \"Away from Her\" and \"The Bucket List.\" While \"The Bucket List\" is definitely a \"feel good\" movie, \"Away from Her\" is more nuanced, dealing with the challenges of aging and Alzheimer's disease. It's known for its emotional depth and sensitive portrayal of characters. Comparing this movie to \"Away from Her\" suggests that the reviewer sees it as a serious, emotionally impactful film, not necessarily a light-hearted one.\n\nAt one point, the reviewer says they didn't like Hagar\u2014not even a little bit. But then they mention starting to like her as they understand her more. This shift from dislike to empathy is a significant part of the movie's effect on them. The fact that they describe Hagar's transformation and their own emotional journey in such detail indicates that the movie had a profound impact.\n\nWhile the movie isn't \"feel good,\" the reviewer doesn't present this as a negative. Instead, they seem to appreciate the authenticity and the way the movie brings them to empathy. The movie has made them understand more clearly why people have hard edges. This understanding suggests a positive experience, even if the movie deals with difficult themes.\n\nThe reviewer also heaps praise on Ellen Burnstyn's performance, calling her a \"brilliant actor\" and praising a particular scene repeatedly with \"Kudos. Kudos. Kudos.\" This enthusiasm is hard to ignore. The director's masterful handling of the challenging character is also commended. All these positive comments about the acting and direction outweigh the initial negative description of the character.\n\nLet's consider the overall tone. The review starts with \"I really liked it\" and ends with a recommendation: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" The reviewer is essentially asking us to confirm that the review is positive. Even though there are negative aspects mentioned\u2014Hagar's unlikable character\u2014the review is overwhelmingly positive about the movie's impact, the acting, and the direction.\n\nI did consider the initial negative reaction to Hagar, thinking, \"Wait, the main character is unlikable, and the movie isn't 'feel good'\u2014could this be negative?\" But then I remembered that movies aren't always about likable characters or happy endings. Some of the most powerful and well-regarded films deal with difficult subjects and complex, unlikable characters. The Godfather, American Psycho, and even works like Taxi Driver come to mind. These movies aren't necessarily \"feel good,\" but they are highly acclaimed and can have a deep emotional impact on viewers.\n\nIn this review, the fact that the movie challenges the viewer and leads to empathy and understanding is presented as a strength, not a weakness. The reviewer's emotional journey\u2014from dislike to empathy\u2014is a testament to the movie's power.

            "question": "Given the question statement:How could I possibly pass up the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /><br />Though I flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review to determine whether the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is positive or negative.\n\nFirst, let's break down the review. The reviewer starts with enthusiasm, expressing excitement about seeing Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together. They rented the movie, which turned out to be \"a mess,\" but perhaps that's a bit hyperbolic. Wait, they were initially drawn in by the stars, but their experience didn't quite live up to expectations.\n\nThe movie is about Ned Kelly, a figure the reviewer had never heard of. They were surprised by his legend and also surprised at how mediocre the movie was. The timing might have been a factor\u2014it was very late, and they were at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon. However, they also acknowledge that the movie is \"a little slow,\" making the story difficult to follow, not because it's complicated, but because of its pace.\n\nDespite the slow pace, Ledger and Bloom shine. They managed to create \"interesting, dimensional characters,\" which is a positive note. The reviewer hesitates to recommend the movie as a must-see but acknowledges that it's a great story of Australian history, especially considering the country's youth. This historical value is something to appreciate, and the film does have some good action sequences.\n\nThe reviewer concludes with a rating of 6/10 and suggests seeing the movie for its historical value, though they seem a bit sarcastic with the \"yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;)\" This winking emoticon suggests they're not entirely convinced by their own recommendation.\n\nWait, let's consider the overall tone. The review starts with enthusiasm but quickly turns to disappointment. The movie is described as a \"mess,\" \"mediocre,\" and \"slow.\" The reviewer had trouble following the story due to its pace, and they're not exactly glowing in their recommendation. Even the positive aspects\u2014 Ledger and Bloom's performances and the historical value\u2014are somewhat downplayed.\n\nHowever, the reviewer does find some merit in the movie. They appreciate the performances and acknowledge the historical significance, even if they're a bit sarcastic about it. The rating of 6/10 suggests it's not a terrible movie, just not great.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific sentence in question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" At first glance, this seems like a meta statement, asking us to evaluate the positivity of the sentence itself. But perhaps it's actually a clever way of asking us to determine the overall sentiment of the review.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate it. The review is mixed but leans negative. The negatives\u2014mediocre movie, slow pace, difficulty following the story\u2014are more prominent than the positives. Even the mention of historical value comes across as a bit obligatory and sarcastic.\n\nI briefly considered whether the reviewer might be more positive than they let on, especially with the \"must see\" comment. But then I remembered the \"yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;)\" That winking emoticon is a dead giveaway\u2014they're not entirely serious about recommending it for historical value alone.\n\nPerhaps the movie is better than the review suggests, but based on the review itself, the overall sentiment is negative. The reviewer rented it because of the stars, was disappointed, and only found a few redeeming qualities.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in \"Glen or Glenda?\"<br /><br />The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians -- who speak very questionable \"Russian\" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />If one isn't interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this movie review and determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The review opens by stating that the movie has one of the strangest themes in history, comparing it to Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\"\u2014a film known for its eccentricity. The theme in question is playing bridge, which is portrayed as a universal activity among various social groups, from the Park Avenue set to Bohemians and even Russians working in a restaurant. However, the reviewer notes that the Russians have very questionable accents, both in \"Russian\" and English, which suggests a level of disbelief or annoyance with this aspect of the film.\n\nThe review continues by stating that if one isn't interested in bridge, they're unlikely to be much interested in this bizarre movie. This implies that the movie's appeal is quite narrow, limited to those already engaged with the game. Wait, the reviewer does offer some praise\u2014Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are described as fine actors. However, there's a bit of a snag: Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter, and Lukas is an unlikely Russian. This suggests that the casting or character choices may be stretching credibility.\n\nBut then the reviewer delivers a damning blow: \"They are all sunk by the fetishistic script.\" The use of \"fetishistic\" here is interesting. At first glance, it might seem positive, perhaps suggesting a passionate or obsessive focus on bridge. But considering the context, especially the preceding criticisms, it's more likely that \"fetishistic\" is used negatively to imply an unhealthy or excessive fixation on the subject matter. The script is so focused on bridge that it becomes a detriment to the movie as a whole.\n\nThe reviewer seems to be saying that even with a great cast, the movie isn't much good because of its strange and excessive focus on bridge. The overall tone is one of mild amusement mixed with exasperation. The movie is bizarre and seems to be a labor of love for bridge, but it's not particularly enjoyable or successful as entertainment.\n\nNow, let's consider the final sentence: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Hmm, this is a bit of a head-scratcher. Is the sentence referring to the entire review, the previous sentence, or something else? Let's try to interpret it.\n\nGiven the context, it's most likely asking whether the final assessment of the movie is positive or negative. We've established that the review is predominantly negative, with the movie being criticized for its strange theme, questionable accents, unlikely casting, and fetishistic script. The praise for the actors is outweighed by these criticisms.\n\nWait, perhaps the sentence is asking about the sentiment of the entire review. Given that the review is mostly negative, the answer would be 0.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the sentence structure. The sentence says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's a bit meta, referring to itself. So, is the sentence positive or negative?\n\nLet's break it down. The sentence is essentially a prompt asking us to determine the sentiment of the review and provide a binary answer: 1 for positive, 0 for negative. The sentence itself is neutral; it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about the movie. It's simply asking a question.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The review starts by noting that the year 2022 in the movie resembles the 1970s, which is initially amusing. However, as the viewer watches, they realize that despite the familiar appearance, the world is actually very different and decadent, with the implication that many things we take for granted could become unavailable. This sets a somewhat cautionary and thought-provoking tone.\n\nThe characters interact in a peculiar way, lacking tact, manners, or respect. At first glance, this might seem like bad acting, but the reviewer believes it's intentional. They suggest that someone who lived through the social changes of the 60s and 70s might assume that by 2022, an overpopulated city's inhabitants would behave this way. So, the odd interactions are seen as a deliberate reflection of a dystopian future, not a flaw in the acting.\n\nMoving on to the action scenes, the reviewer admits they didn't like most of them, except for the death of the priest, which they found too cheap even for the seventies. The plot isn't described as polished, either. Wait, but here's where the review takes a turn. Despite these shortcomings, the reviewer highlights several great scenes and ideas. They mention the death of Sol, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, and the concept of \"furniture\" as standout elements that outweigh the film's flaws.\n\nThe review ends with a rating of 8 out of 10. Now, is this positive or negative? Let's consider the structure and tone. The review starts with a positive observation about the amusing anachronism, then touches on negative aspects like the characters' interactions and the action scenes. However, the reviewer attributes the odd character behavior to intentional stylistic choices, not poor acting, which mitigates the negative impression.\n\nWe might be tempted to focus on the negative comments about the action scenes and the plot not being polished, especially with phrases like \"I didn't like most of the action scenes\" and \"the plot isn't too polished.\" But the reviewer's overall assessment is quite positive. They emphasize that the great scenes and ideas outweigh the shortcomings, and they give the movie a solid 8 out of 10.\n\nI could get bogged down in the details\u2014does \"I didn't like most of the action scenes\" count as negative? Yes. Does \"the plot isn't too polished\" lean negative? Maybe. But the review ends on such a positive note, and the 8 out of 10 rating is a clear indicator. The reviewer even says, \"But the great scenes and ideas... outweigh the shortcomings of this film,\" which is a strong positive statement.\n\nThinking about the scale, 8 out of 10 is definitely positive. If we consider that 5 is neutral, anything above that is positive. My initial instinct was that the review is positive, and while the action scenes and plot got a thumbs down, the overall experience seems to have been enjoyable.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate this. An 8 out of 10 is a good score, and the reviewer's final thoughts are overwhelmingly positive. The negative aspects are mentioned, but they are outweighed by the positives. I don't want to get stuck on the negative comments and miss the forest for the trees. Yes, the review is positive.\n\nLet's be honest\u2014this is a solid 8 out of 10. The negative bits are outweighed by the positive, and the rating is clearly positive. The reviewer didn't hate the movie; they had some criticisms, but overall, they enjoyed it and thought it had many great moments.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off to the ball, with the warning to return home by midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later get married, and they live happily ever after.<br /><br />Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including \"A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes\", \"So This Is Love\", and the great \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\", help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasn't lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S.

The text is a review of the classic Disney movie \"Cinderella,\" and it's clear from the outset that the reviewer holds the film in high regard.\n\nThe review starts by summarizing the story, setting the stage for the positive comments that follow. It mentions that \"Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success,\" which is already a positive statement. The film \"continues to charm audiences to this day,\" further emphasizing its enduring appeal.\n\nThe reviewer praises various aspects of the movie, stating that it has a \"well-written script\" and that the \"characters are memorable.\" This is followed by a compliment on the music: \"The songs, including 'A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes,' 'So This Is Love,' and the great 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,' help tell the story.\" These are all positive attributes that contribute to the overall favorable review.\n\nThe personal touch adds weight to the positivity. The reviewer says, \"This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasn't lost any of its charm.\" This emotional connection reinforces the idea that the review is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWait, the reviewer even goes so far as to call it \"A true Disney masterpiece!\" There's no ambiguity here\u2014the exclamation mark drives home the enthusiasm. The recommendation is clear: \"Recommended. 10/10.\" It doesn't get much more positive than a perfect score.\n\nBut the positivity doesn't stop there. The reviewer also mentions the recent DVD release, describing it as \"the best way to appreciate this film.\" They rave about the additional content, including \"featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs, and a restored print of the movie!\" This enthusiasm for the special edition further underscores the reviewer's positive opinion.\n\nThroughout the entire text, there are no negative comments. Even the mention of Cinderella's cruel treatment by her stepmother and stepsisters is presented as part of the story, not as a criticism of the film. The review is filled with superlatives like \"huge box office success,\" \"charming,\" \"memorable,\" \"great,\" \"favorite,\" \"enduring appeal,\" \"masterpiece,\" and \"Recommended. 10/10.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of \"real teen life.\" Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, \"a film teens should see because it's about them.\" Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like \"Pups\" or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're asked to determine whether the given sentence is positive or negative, with a positive answer being 1 and a negative answer being 0.\n\nFirst, let's identify the sentence in question. The text provided is a review of a film seen at the SF Independent Film Festival, followed by a question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, the review is quite lengthy, and it's not immediately clear which specific sentence we're supposed to evaluate.\n\nHowever, the structure of the text suggests that the entire review is considered the \"sentence\" in question. The review is quite positive, filled with praises for the film's storyline, characters, and portrayal of real life. The audience raved about it, and the director, Jim McKay, is described as extremely sensitive and detailed in his work.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The reviewer couldn't wait to get a copy of the film after seeing it.\n- The audience, described as multi-racial, multi-gendered, and mostly adults, raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and portrayal of \"real teen life.\"\n- The reviewer mentions that most of the teens had left, leading them to think the film is best seen by adults with kids for discussion, rather than as a film teens should see because it's about them. This seems more like a observation about the target audience rather than a negative comment on the film itself.\n- The reviewer notes that distribution questions arise because the film might be buried like other radical modern teen films, but McKay seems responsive.\n- McKay is described as extremely sensitive and detailed in his work, allying himself with the Crown Heights neighborhood and working with actors to portray characters in their own vision, resulting in disarmingly realistic performances.\n\nThroughout the review, the tone is overwhelmingly positive. Even the mention of distribution challenges doesn't detract from the reviewer's appreciation of the film. The reviewer seems to be expressing enthusiasm for the film and interest in how to obtain a copy.\n\nPerhaps we're overcomplicating things by trying to pinpoint a specific sentence. The entire passage is a positive review, and the final question is essentially asking, \"If you think this review is positive, answer 1; if negative, answer 0.\"\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n- If we think the sentence (the review) is positive, the answer is 1.\n- If we think the sentence is negative, the answer is 0.\n\nGiven the overwhelmingly positive nature of the review, it seems clear that the answer should be 1.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's revisit the structure. The review is followed by the question, and then there's a bit more text: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This feels like a direct instruction tied to the review.\n\nMy first instinct was to focus on the review itself, which is positive. But wait, could \"this sentence\" be referring to something else? Maybe the last sentence? Let's consider that.\n\nThe last sentence is: \"McKay was extremely sensitive and detailed in his work\u2014allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be\u2014with the results being disarmingly realistic.\"\n\nThis sentence is also positive, praising McKay's sensitivity, detail, and the realistic results of his work. So even if \"this sentence\" refers to the last one, the answer is still 1.\n\nPerhaps the question is intentionally vague to see how we interpret it. But regardless of whether \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review or just the last sentence, the answer is positive.\n\nA brief moment of doubt creeps in\u2014what if \"this sentence\" refers to something else entirely? But the context suggests it's tied to the review or the last sentence.\n\nI did consider the mention of teens leaving the theater, which might seem negative. However, the reviewer interprets this as the film being better suited for adults with kids, not as a criticism of the film itself.\n\nAt one point, I thought about the distribution challenges mentioned, but the reviewer frames this as a question of how to get the film out there, not as a negative comment on the film's quality.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick, designed to make us think too deeply about it. But ultimately, the review is positive, and the question seems straightforward.\n\nEven if we're supposed to consider the entire passage, including the question, the overall tone is positive.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny. Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of his \"work\"...and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a \"movie\" rental. Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it. Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness.<br /><br />This \"thing\" he \"assembled\" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage) are terrible in this. Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent (in all fields), desperate to grab onto any \"loser\" attention he can for himself. He is to be pitied.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this question step by step. We're given a scathing review of a film by Sam Mraovich and asked to determine whether the statement \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\" is positive or negative.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit tricky. The review itself is overwhelmingly negative, filled with vitriol directed at Sam Mraovich and his work. The reviewer calls the film \"garbage,\" \"crap,\" \"offensive,\" and \"irresponsible junk,\" and describes Mraovich as \"exceedingly untalented,\" \"warped,\" and \"a man-child.\" They also express anger and disappointment, threaten to have the video removed from the store, and claim it's detrimental to gay cinema and rights.\n\nHowever, the question is about the statement: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This statement is a conditional instruction, not a description of the review or Mraovich's work. It's essentially saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, then answer 1; otherwise, answer 0.\"\n\nBut what sentence is it referring to? The phrase \"this sentence\" is ambiguous. Is it referring to the entire review, the immediately preceding sentence, or the sentence containing the statement itself?\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. **If \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review:** The review is clearly negative, so \"this sentence\" is negative. According to the statement, if it's negative, the answer is 0.\n\n2. **If \"this sentence\" refers to the immediately preceding sentence:** Looking back, there isn't an immediately preceding sentence because the statement is at the beginning of the question. Wait, perhaps \"this sentence\" refers to the last sentence of the review. The last sentence is \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" That brings us back to the statement itself, leading us into a loop.\n\n3. **If \"this sentence\" refers to the sentence containing the statement itself:** Let's analyze the sentence \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Is this sentence positive or negative?\n\n   Let's think about it. The sentence is neutral\u2014it's providing instructions based on the positivity or negativity of \"this sentence.\" It's not expressing a positive or negative opinion about anything. It's like saying, \"If it's raining, take an umbrella; otherwise, wear sunglasses.\" The statement itself is neutral, regardless of the weather.\n\nBut wait, perhaps we're overcomplicating this. Maybe the key is to consider the instruction: if the sentence is positive, answer 1; if negative, answer 0. Since the sentence is neutral, does that mean it's not positive? Let's go with that.\n\nHowever, let's revisit the review to ensure we're not missing anything. The review is negative, but the question is about the statement, not the review. The statement is neutral.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing our ability to distinguish between the content of the review and the instruction in the question. The review is negative, but the statement is neutral.\n\nWait, but the statement says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" If \"this sentence\" is the statement itself, and the statement is neutral, then it's not positive, so the answer is 0.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n- If \"this sentence\" is positive, answer 1.\n- If \"this sentence\" is negative, answer 0.\n\nBut \"this sentence\" is neutral, so neither condition is met. However, the statement only provides instructions for if the sentence is positive or negative, not if it's neutral. Perhaps we need to assume that if it's not positive, then it's negative.\n\nWait, but the statement says, \"and the negative answer is 0.\" So if the sentence is negative, the answer is 0.\n\nBut the sentence is neutral, not negative.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Perhaps we need to consider that the statement is neutral, so the answer is 0.\n\nAfter much reflection, I'm convinced that the statement is neutral, and since it's not positive, the answer is 0.\n\nA quick side note: while the review is full of hyperbole and strong language, it's clear the reviewer didn't like the film. But the question is about the statement, not the review.\n\nI briefly considered the possibility that the entire review is \"this sentence,\" but that seems unlikely. The question is about the statement, not the review.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking whether the statement is positive or negative.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Didn't Mystic Pizza win the Oscar for that year? This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater. Only \"Wargames\" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future. History has shown that this is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to \"run\" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as \"Captain Freedom\" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as \"Subzero,\" both \"stalkers\" who kill the \"running men.\" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the \"dancers of the future\" are none other than the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS \"80s.\" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as \"contestants.\" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.<br /><br />The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for \"national security\" is downright chilling. Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.<br /><br />The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the \"ravine\" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. \"Serious\" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their \"common man\" counterparts, such as this one.<br /><br />An absolute must-see.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's analyze the text to determine whether the sentence \"An absolute must-see\" is positive or negative.\n\nThe review is overwhelmingly positive. The author expresses their admiration for the movie \"The Running Man,\" praising the casting as a \"pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s,\" despite acknowledging some flaws like poor production value and cheesy lines. They describe the plot as a \"good excuse for the action\" and highlight Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance as \"brilliant.\" The review also commends the movie's prophetic quality, suggesting it foresaw aspects of the future, such as the influence of the government on the media and the public's surrender of freedoms for entertainment.\n\nThe author compares \"The Running Man\" favorably to \"Wargames,\" another movie they seem to hold in high regard, and laments that the academy didn't recognize the screenplay's worth, implying that more \"pretentious\" films often win Oscars over more deserving ones. The closing statement, \"An absolute must-see,\" is a clear recommendation, leaving no doubt about the reviewer's positive opinion.\n\nEven though the review mentions some negative aspects, such as the movie being \"way over the top\" and \"off the cliff for its time,\" these are outweighed by the numerous positive comments. The reviewer acknowledges that while the movie might have seemed far-fetched at the time, it has aged well and is now seen as prophetic.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:FORGET CREDIBILITY<br /><br />You must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when Renny Harlin is directing.<br /><br />\"CLIFFHANGER \" is no exception. But the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( Stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( Janine Turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass ) Good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film )\"It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\"<br /><br />If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:###Thinking\n\nLet's tackle this problem step by step. We're given a text review of the movie \"Cliffhanger\" and asked to determine whether the final sentence is positive or negative. The instruction is to answer with 1 if it's positive and 0 if it's negative.\n\nFirst, let's understand the context of the review. The text starts by acknowledging that action movies, especially those directed by Renny Harlin, often feature superheroes performing unbelievable feats and recovering quickly from being \"trodden upon.\" The review then states that \"Cliffhanger\" is no exception to this lack of credibility.\n\nWait, but the review doesn't stop there. It goes on to highlight numerous assets of the movie, painting a positive picture. The scenery is described as breathtaking and gorgeously photographed. The special and visual effects are stunning, with the first five minutes being particularly gripping. The musical score is excellent, and there are welcome moments of levity to relieve tension.\n\nThe cast is also praised as solid. Sylvester Stallone, the star and cowriter, gets the lion's share of the footage, but Michael Rooker more than holds his own. Janine Turner is described as a charming heroine, and the villains are one of the most darstardy (a typo, likely meaning \"desperate\" or perhaps \"dastardly\") bunch ever, with standout performances from John Lithgow, Caroline Goodall, Rex Linn, and Craig Fairbrass.\n\nThroughout the review, the tone is overwhelmingly positive. Even the mention of the movie lacking credibility is framed more as an expectation of the genre rather than a significant criticism. The reviewer seems to be saying, \"Yes, the credibility is stretched, but so what? This movie delivers on so many other fronts.\"\n\nThen we come to the final sentence: \"Good, solid entertainment then, if no credibility.\" At first glance, the phrase \"if no credibility\" might seem like a negative, but in the context of the review, it's more of a minor quibble. The reviewer has already established that the movie excels in visuals, effects, music, and performances. The lack of credibility is outweighed by these positive aspects.\n\nThe review concludes with a quote from Roger Ebert about another film: \"It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\" This reinforces the idea that the movie is meant to be enjoyed without overthinking its plot or credibility issues. It's a lighthearted, entertaining film, and that's precisely what the reviewer is appreciating.\n\nI initially wondered if the mention of no credibility might tip the balance towards negative, but the overall tone of the review is so positive that it's clear the reviewer enjoyed the movie despite its lack of credibility. The \"if no credibility\" is almost a parenthetical aside, acknowledging a common trait of the genre rather than a major flaw.\n\nJust to be thorough, I considered the structure of the final sentence. \"Good, solid entertainment then, if no credibility\" could be interpreted as \"Good, solid entertainment, even though it has no credibility.\" This phrasing suggests that the lack of credibility is a minor issue compared to the overall entertainment value.\n\nCould the final sentence be negative? It's possible to read \"if no credibility\" as a slight, but given the context, that seems unlikely. The review has been so positive up to this point that it would be a bit of a shock if the final sentence suddenly turned negative.\n\nThinking about the quote from Roger Ebert, it's clear that the reviewer is adopting a similar attitude. They're saying, \"Don't worry about the credibility gaps; just sit back and enjoy the ride.\" This is a hallmark of positive reviews for genre films\u2014acknowledging the plot may not be realistic but praising the film for what it does well.\n\nMy first instinct was that the final sentence is positive, and after carefully considering the context and the overall tone of the review, I'm confident in that assessment. The lack of credibility is mentioned, but it's not a deal-breaker. The reviewer clearly enjoyed the movie and considers it good, solid entertainment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

It continues to highlight the performances, stating that Richard Chamberlain gives a \"good performance\" and that David Gulpilil plays his role effectively, doing his best to guide Chamberlain through the realm of 'Dreamtime'. So far, so positive.\n\nThe review mentions that the film is \"heavy on atmosphere,\" which is generally a compliment for a chiller. It also notes that the plotting is \"deliberately ambiguous,\" which, depending on the genre, can be seen as a strength.

However, this criticism is somewhat downplayed, and the reviewer quickly moves on to the positive aspects. The movie is still described as \"very entertaining,\" which is a strong positive statement.\n\nMorris Day and Jerome Benton are highlighted for their all-time classic comedy, particularly their rendition of \"The Password,\" which is compared favorably to Abbott & Costello's famous \"Who's on First\" routine. This is a significant compliment, suggesting that their comedic performance was outstanding.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions Appolina, noting her attractiveness and the fact that she provided \"some beautiful breasts\" and \"brief nudity.\" While this might be considered a minor aspect, it's presented as a positive feature of the movie.\n\nFurthermore, the soundtrack is praised as one of Prince's best ever recorded, which is a major compliment given Prince's musical talent. The reviewer acknowledges that Prince later had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but\u5f3a\u8c03 at the time the movie was released, he was at the top of his game.\n\nDespite the movie not ranking in the all-time great category, the reviewer concludes that it is \"pretty entertaining.\" The overall tone of the review is overwhelmingly positive, with the negatives (bad acting, being an extended music video) being minor and outweighed by the positives.\n\nEven though the acting isn't great, the reviewer seems to shrug that off as an expected flaw when musicians act. The entertainment value is high, the comedy is classic, the music is excellent, and there's even a nod to the eye candy. The reviewer doesn't seem to hold the acting against the movie too much, considering it's Prince's first foray into film.\n\nWait, I did briefly wonder if the mention of it not being an all-time great might tip the balance, but the review is peppered with so many positives that it's hard to argue it's negative overall. The reviewer might not love it, but they certainly think it's worth watching.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.

Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended music video. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all-time classic comedy, especially their rendition of \"The Password\", which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their \"who's on first\" baseball routine.<br /><br />Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. Plus, she is very attractive. And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.<br /><br />This movie doesn't rank in the all-time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.
