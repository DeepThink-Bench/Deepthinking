            "question": "Given the question statement:The Texans and Patriots faced off on Sunday Night Football in a game with playoff implications for both teams. Houston received the opening kickoff, going into a three-and-out on the drive. On New England's second drive, Tom Brady found tight end Rob Gronkowski for a 40-yard reception to set up first and goal. To end the drive, Brady found Keshawn Martin for a 2-yard touchdown pass. With Stephen Gostkowski making the extra point the Patriots took a 7-0 lead. On 3rd and 18, Brian Hoyer found Nate Washington for a 49-yard pass to put Houston at New England's 25 yard line. The Texans ended the drive with a 37-yard field goal from Nick Novak to trail 3-7 late in the 1st quarter. The Patriots extended their lead early in the 2nd quarter to 10-3 with a 43-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. After struggling to find their run game after the loss of Arian Foster, Jonathan Grimes took off for 37 yards to put the Texans at the Patriots' 43 yard line. The drive ended with another Novak field goal, this time from 45 yards. With Novak's kick good, Houston trailed 6-10 with 9:26 left in the half. To close out the first half, Tom Brady found Gronkowski for a 1-yard touchdown pass. With Gostkowski making the extra point New England extended their lead to 17-6 going into halftime. The Texans failed to score in the 2nd half, falling to the Patriots 27-6. Hoyer left the game late in the 4th quarter due to a possible concussion, with T. J. Yates coming in as the starting quarterback.Who made the most field goals in the first half?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this football game to analyze between the Texans and the Patriots. It sounds like it was an important game for both teams since it had playoff implications. Let me try to understand what happened in the game step by step.\n\nFirst, the Texans received the opening kickoff but didn't do much with it; they had a three-and-out, which means they didn't gain any significant yardage and punted the ball back to the Patriots. So, the Patriots got the ball next.\n\nOn their second drive, Tom Brady, who's the quarterback for the Patriots, threw a 40-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski, who's a tight end. That big gain set up the Patriots inside the Texans' red zone, and eventually, Brady threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Keshawn Martin. Gostkowski kicked the extra point, so the score was 7-0 Patriots.\n\nThen, on the Texans' next possession, on 3rd and 18, Brian Hoyer, the Texans' quarterback, threw a 49-yard pass to Nate Washington, which was a big gain. They ended up with a field goal attempt from 37 yards, which Nick Novak made, so the score became 7-3 Patriots.\n\nLater, the Patriots extended their lead with a 43-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making it 10-3.\n\nAfter that, the Texans had a big run by Jonathan Grimes, who went for 37 yards, putting them in a good position at the Patriots' 43-yard line. They ended that drive with another field goal, this time from 45 yards by Novak, so the score was 10-6.\n\nThen, near the end of the first half, Brady threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, and Gostkowski kicked another extra point, making it 17-6 Patriots at halftime.\n\nIn the second half, the Texans didn't score any points, and the final score was 27-6 Patriots. Hoyer left the game late due to a possible concussion, and T.J. Yates came in as the starting quarterback.\n\nNow, the question is: Who made the most field goals in the first half?\n\nLet me see. In the first half, we have:\n\n- Novak made a 37-yard field goal and a 45-yard field goal, so that's two field goals.\n\n- Gostkowski made a 43-yard field goal and probably another one for the extra point after the touchdown, but extra points are different from field goals.\n\nWait, in football, extra points are worth one point, and field goals are worth three points. So, Gostkowski kicked a field goal and some extra points.\n\nBut the question is specifically about field goals in the first half.\n\nFrom what I can see:\n\n- Novak made two field goals: 37 yards and 45 yards.\n\n- Gostkowski made one field goal: 43 yards.\n\nSo, Novak made more field goals in the first half.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, the sequence of events:\n\n1. Patriots score a touchdown, 7-0.\n\n2. Texans drive ends with a 37-yard field goal, 7-3.\n\n3. Patriots kick a 43-yard field goal, 10-3.\n\n4. Texans have a big run, end with a 45-yard field goal, 10-6.\n\n5. Patriots score another touchdown, 17-6 at halftime.\n\nSo, field goals in the first half:\n\n- Novak: 37 yards and 45 yards.\n\n- Gostkowski: 43 yards.\n\nSo, Novak made two field goals, and Gostkowski made one.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years. Including the loss to the Redskins on Monday Night, the Cowboys have played in a total of 75 Monday Night games and have an overall record of 43-32.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Chiefs kicker John Carney managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City regained the lead as QB Damon Huard completed a 2-yard TD pass to DE Jared Allen. Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs. Also, CB Antonio Cromartie recorded 2 INT to bring his league-leading total to 8.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Setu coins or Setu bull coins are found in large quantities in the northern part of Sri Lanka and in Southern India. Codrington in his book Ceylon Coins and Currency published in 1924 and Mitchiner in his book Oriental Coins published in 1978 have clearly pointed out that the traditional design of Sri Lanka standing King Type Copper Massa  of the Jaffna Kingdoms belongs to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD. Setu coins were previously attributed to the Setupati Princes of Ramanathapuram in South India. There are two series one in the issued from the 13th to the 15th centuries and the other after the brief loss of sovereignty to the rival Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467 and reconstitution of the Kingdom. Even during the rule of Sapumal Kumaraya coins were issued in Jaffna that was distinct. Three types of this series are illustrated below. The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi  symbol, the legend Sethu in Tamil with a crescent moon above. There are number of categories of these coins. In type I  is closely aligned with the Chola copper coins of the 13th century although slightly larger in size. The Tamil Setu replaces the Nagari Rajaraja in the cola coins. In type I  the blank is even broader but a recumbent bull appera obverse in a vertical position. In the coin type II the seated figure is replaced with a Bull.How many years did the Aryacakravarti dynasty last?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about Setu coins and the Aryacakravarti dynasty from the Jaffna Kingdom in Sri Lanka. The text mentions that these coins are found in large quantities in the northern part of Sri Lanka and in southern India. It references two books: one by Codrington from 1924 and another by Mitchiner from 1978, which both discuss the history of these coins and their connection to the Aryacakravarti dynasty.\n\nThe Aryacakravarti dynasty is said to have lasted from 1284 AD to 1410 AD. The text also talks about two series of Setu coins: one from the 13th to the 15th centuries and another after a period when the kingdom lost sovereignty to the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467, followed by the reconstitution of the kingdom.\n\nThere's also mention of different types of these coins, with variations in design, such as human figures, lamps, the Nandi symbol, and the legend \"Sethu\" in Tamil with a crescent moon above. The text notes that some types are similar to Chola copper coins from the 13th century, but with differences like the use of Tamil \"Setu\" instead of Nagari \"Rajaraja.\"\n\nThe question is: How many years did the Aryacakravarti dynasty last?\n\nOkay, so to find out how long the dynasty lasted, I need to calculate the difference between the ending year and the starting year given.\n\nThe dynasty started in 1284 AD and ended in 1410 AD.\n\nSo, the calculation should be:\n\n1410 - 1284 = ?\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n1410 minus 1284.\n\nFirst, subtract 1280 from 1400: 1400 - 1280 = 120.\n\nThen, subtract the remaining 4: 120 - 4 = 116.\n\nSo, the dynasty lasted for 116 years.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\n1284 to 1410:\n\nFrom 1284 to 1400 is 116 years.\n\nThen from 1400 to 1410 is another 10 years.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting year: 1284\n\nEnding year: 1410\n\nTo find the number of years between two dates, subtract the starting year from the ending year.\n\nSo, 1410 - 1284 = ?\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 1400 - 1284 = 116\n\nThen, add the remaining 10 years from 1400 to 1410, which gives 116 + 10 = 126 years.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that from year X to year Y, the number of years is Y - X.\n\nSo, 1410 - 1284 = 126 years.\n\nLet me confirm this with an example.\n\nFor instance, from 2000 to 2023 is 23 years.\n\nSimilarly, from 1284 to 1410 should be 1410 - 1284 = 126 years.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off a defensively-strong performance against the Cardinals, the Panthers flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 9 NFC South duel with the undefeated New Orleans Saints.  Carolina got off to a fast start in the first quarter as running back DeAngelo Williams got a 66-yard and a 7-yard touchdown run.  The Saints would get on the board in the second quarter as kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal.  The Panthers came right back as kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal, but New Orleans would close out the half as Carney booted a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints continued to hack away as running back Pierre Thomas got a 10-yard touchdown run.  Carolina answered with Kasay's 25-yard field goal, but New Orleans would tie the game to end the period as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem.  Afterwards, the Saints would pull away in the fourth quarter with Carney's 40-yard field goal, followed by defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove forcing a fumble from Williams and returning it 1 yard for a touchdown.How many field goals were kicked in the second quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Panthers and the Saints. It's talking about field goals scored in the second quarter. Let me read the text carefully to find out how many field goals were kicked in that quarter.\n\nFirst, it says that in the first quarter, the Panthers scored two touchdowns with DeAngelo Williams running for 66 yards and 7 yards. Then, in the second quarter, the kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal for the Saints. After that, the Panthers' kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal. Finally, the Saints' Carney booted a 25-yard field goal before halftime.\n\nSo, in the second quarter, there are two field goals mentioned: one by Carney from 23 yards and another by Kasay from 32 yards, and then another one by Carney from 25 yards. Wait, no, let's check that again.\n\nActually, it says:\n\n- The Saints' Carney made a 23-yard field goal.\n\n- Then, the Panthers' Kasay made a 32-yard field goal.\n\n- And the Saints' Carney made a 25-yard field goal before halftime.\n\nSo, that's three field goals in the second quarter: two by Carney and one by Kasay.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other field goals in the second quarter that I might have missed. The text mentions:\n\n- First quarter: two touchdowns by Williams.\n\n- Second quarter: Carney's 23-yard FG, Kasay's 32-yard FG, Carney's 25-yard FG.\n\n- Then it moves on to the third quarter with a touchdown by Pierre Thomas and so on.\n\nSo, indeed, there are three field goals in the second quarter.\n\nBut the question is: \"How many field goals were kicked in the second quarter?\" and it's a math problem, so I need to provide a numerical answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider if all these field goals were successful. The text says \"made\" and \"booted,\" which imply that they were successful. So, in football, a field goal attempted and made counts as a field goal kicked.\n\nSo, three field goals were kicked and all were successful.\n\nBut the question just asks for the number of field goals kicked, not the number of successful ones, although in football, typically, field goals kicked refer to those attempted, regardless of whether they were good or not. But in this context, since it's a math problem and the text specifies that they made the field goals, I think it's safe to assume that all kicked field goals were successful.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years.

Suddenly, the Texans' defense broke through with only a few seconds remaining after Garrard made a 50-yard TD pass to WR Mike Thomas. The ball was batted into his hands by Texans Defensive back Glover Quin, who made an attempt to bat the ball to the ground.How many total yards of TD passes were thrown by Garrard?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Texans and the Jaguars. It's talking about a bunch of scoring plays, and specifically, it's asking for the total yards of touchdown passes thrown by the quarterback David Garrard. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the touchdown passes that Garrard threw during this game. According to the text, there are two mentions of Garrard throwing touchdown passes.\n\nThe first one is: \"QB David Garrard completed a 52-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller.\" So, that's one touchdown pass for 52 yards.\n\nThe second one is: \"Suddenly, the Texans' defense broke through with only a few seconds remaining after Garrard made a 50-yard TD pass to WR Mike Thomas.\" So, that's another touchdown pass for 50 yards.\n\nNow, I need to add these two together to get the total yards of TD passes thrown by Garrard.\n\n52 yards + 50 yards = 102 yards.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? Let me double-check the text to make sure I didn't miss any other touchdown passes by Garrard.\n\nLooking back, the first touchdown was a 52-yard pass to Zach Miller, and the second was a 50-yard pass to Mike Thomas. No other touchdown passes by Garrard are mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the total yards of TD passes thrown by Garrard is 102 yards.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's some confusion or additional information I'm missing. The text also mentions that the ball was batted into Mike Thomas's hands by Texans' defensive back Glover Quin, who tried to bat it to the ground. However, this seems to be describing an interception or some sort of defensive play, but it doesn't mention another touchdown pass. It's just providing extra context about how the second touchdown pass was caught.\n\nSo, sticking to the touchdown passes mentioned:\n\nFirst: 52 yards\n\nSecond: 50 yards\n\nTotal: 102 yards\n\nI think that's the answer. Unless there's something I'm overlooking, but based on the information provided, that seems correct.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington.

Afterwards, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City regained the lead as QB Damon Huard completed a 2-yard TD pass to DE Jared Allen. Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Vlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".Which was the larger army, Vlad \u0162epe\u015f' or the Turkish Army?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about Vlad the Impaler and the Turkish army. It says that Vlad asked the Hungarian king for help, but didn't get any, and instead had to mobilize his own forces, including men, women, and children as young as twelve, plus some Gypsy slave contingents. The sources mention his army size between 22,000 and 30,900, with 30,000 being the most accepted number. There's also a mention of a letter by Leonardo Tocco that exaggerates both the Turkish army's size to 400,000 and Wallachian strength to 200,000. The majority of Vlad's army was made up of peasants and shepherds, with boyars on horseback being few in number, and Vlad's personal guard consisting of mercenaries from various countries and some Gypsies.\n\nThe question is, which army was larger: Vlad the Impaler's or the Turkish army?\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sizes of both armies based on the information provided.\n\nFor Vlad's army:\n\n- The text mentions sizes between 22,000 and 30,900, with 30,000 being the most accepted number.\n\nFor the Turkish army:\n\n- The letter by Leonardo Tocco exaggerates their number to 400,000.\n\nBut it's important to note that the letter exaggerates both army sizes. So, 400,000 for the Turkish army is likely an overestimation.\n\nHowever, the question is to determine which army was larger based on the information given, and it seems that the only numbers provided are these exaggerated ones and the more realistic range for Vlad's army.\n\nGiven that, even if we take the highest estimate for Vlad's army, which is 30,900, it's still significantly smaller than the exaggerated Turkish army size of 400,000.\n\nBut, since the Turkish army size is likely exaggerated, perhaps I should look for a more accurate estimate.\n\nWait, the text says that Leonardo Tocco's letter put the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, and Wallachian strength at 200,000, but then mentions that the most accepted number for Vlad's army is 30,000.\n\nSo, it seems that the actual size of the Turkish army is not specified directly in the text, but its exaggerated size is given as 400,000.\n\nGiven that, and without any other information about the actual size of the Turkish army, it's difficult to make a precise comparison.\n\nHowever, historically, Ottoman armies at that time could be quite large, but 400,000 seems excessively high, especially considering logistics and other practical constraints.\n\nPerhaps a more realistic estimate would be in the tens of thousands, but again, without specific information, it's hard to say.\n\nBut based on the information provided in the text, the only numbers given are the range for Vlad's army (22,000 to 30,900) and the exaggerated Turkish army size of 400,000.\n\nSo, if I have to answer based on the numbers provided, even taking into account that the Turkish army size is exaggerated, 400,000 is still larger than 30,900.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and perhaps there's more to it.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the actual Turkish army size was smaller, but still larger than Vlad's army.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to estimate the Turkish army size based on other information.\n\nWait, the text mentions that Vlad asked for assistance from the Hungarian king but received none despite promises, which might suggest that the Turkish army was perceived as a significant threat, implying it was larger than Vlad's forces.\n\nAlso, considering that Vlad had to mobilize all able-bodied people, including women and children as young as twelve, suggests that his army was not professionally trained and possibly smaller in comparison to the Turkish army.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that he had to call for such a broad mobilization indicates that he was outnumbered.\n\nAdditionally, the boyars on horseback were few in number, which suggests that his cavalry was not substantial, while the Turkish army was known for its strong cavalry, particularly the sipahis and the infamous Janissaries.\n\nMoreover, the Turkish army at that time would have included not only Turks but also various vassal states and allies, which could have swelled its ranks.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the Turkish army was larger than Vlad's army, even if the exaggerated number of 400,000 is not accurate.\n\nPerhaps a more realistic\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

Seattle would trail as Colts running back Donald Brown got a 1-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, followed by quarterback Peyton Manning's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. The Seahawks would get on the board with a 38-yard field goal from kicker Olindo Mare, but Indianapolis would close out the half with Manning's 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Austin Collie. Following running back Joseph Addai's 12-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, the Colts would seal the win with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 37-yard and 19-yard field goals. Seattle would end the game with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck getting a 1-yard touchdown run and completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Owen Schmitt.Which player kicked the second longest field goal?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Seahawks and the Colts. It's from way back in Week 4 of some season, and the Seahawks are trying to break a two-game losing streak. The text goes through the game, describing each scoring play and who did what.\n\nThe question is: \"Which player kicked the second longest field goal?\" Okay, so I need to identify all the field goals kicked in the game, note their lengths, and then determine which one was the second longest, and who kicked it.\n\nFirst, I need to find all the field goals mentioned in the text. Let's go through it step by step.\n\nStarting with the Seahawks' kicker, Olindo Mare, who made a 38-yard field goal. That's one field goal.\n\nThen, later in the game, the Colts' kicker, Adam Vinatieri, made two field goals: one from 37 yards and another from 19 yards.\n\nSo, in total, there are three field goals:\n\n1. Olindo Mare (Seahawks): 38 yards\n\n2. Adam Vinatieri (Colts): 37 yards\n\n3. Adam Vinatieri (Colts): 19 yards\n\nNow, I need to order these field goals by length to find the second longest.\n\nFirst, the longest is Mare's 38-yarder.\n\nSecond, Vinatieri's 37-yarder.\n\nThird, Vinatieri's 19-yarder.\n\nSo, the second longest field goal is Vinatieri's 37-yard kick.\n\nTherefore, the player who kicked the second longest field goal is Adam Vinatieri.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other field goals. The text mentions:\n\n- Brown's 1-yard TD run for the Colts.\n\n- Manning's 5-yard TD pass to Wayne.\n\n- Mare's 38-yard field goal for the Seahawks.\n\n- Manning's 21-yard TD pass to Collie.\n\n- Addai's 12-yard TD run.\n\n- Vinatieri's 37-yard field goal.\n\n- Vinatieri's 19-yard field goal.\n\n- Hasselbeck's 1-yard TD run.\n\n- Hasselbeck's 1-yard TD pass to Schmitt.\n\nThat's all the scoring plays mentioned.

More shogunate troops under Matsudaira Nobutsuna, Itakura's replacement, soon arrived. However, the rebels at Hara Castle resisted the siege for months and caused the shogunate heavy losses. Both sides had a hard time fighting in winter conditions. On February 3, 1638, a rebel raid killed 2,000 warriors from the Hizen Domain. However, despite this minor victory, the rebels slowly ran out of food, ammunition and other provisions. By April 1638, there were over 27,000 rebels facing about 125,000 shogunate soldiers. Desperate rebels mounted an assault against them on April 4 and were forced to withdraw. Captured survivors and the fortress' rumored sole traitor, Yamada Emosaku, revealed the fortress was out of food and gunpowder. On April 12, 1638, troops under the command of the Kuroda clan of Hizen stormed the fortress and captured the outer defenses. The rebels continued to hold out and caused heavy casualties until they were routed on April 15.How many more shogunate soldiers were there compared to rebels in April 1638?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this history problem here, but it's more about numbers, right?

That means I need to subtract the number of rebels from the number of shogunate soldiers.\n\nBut, there's a slight issue here. It says \"over 27,000 rebels\" and \"about 125,000 shogunate soldiers.\" So, the numbers are not exact. \"Over 27,000\" means more than 27,000, but we don't know exactly how many. \"About 125,000\" suggests that 125,000 is an approximation.\n\nIn problems like this, especially in historical contexts, numbers aren't always precise, but for the sake of solving the problem, I think I can proceed with the given approximate figures.\n\nSo, let's assume that there are 27,000 rebels and 125,000 shogunate soldiers.\n\nNow, to find how many more shogunate soldiers there were compared to rebels, I'll subtract the number of rebels from the number of shogunate soldiers:\n\n125,000 - 27,000 = 98,000\n\nSo, there were 98,000 more shogunate soldiers than rebels.\n\nBut wait a minute, the text says \"over 27,000 rebels.\" So, the actual number of rebels could be higher than 27,000. If there were, say, 27,500 rebels, then the difference would be 125,000 - 27,500 = 97,500. If there were 28,000 rebels, then 125,000 - 28,000 = 97,000, and so on.\n\nSince \"over 27,000\" means more than 27,000, the difference would be less than 125,000 - 27,000, which is 98,000.\n\nBut without knowing the exact number of rebels, I can't give an exact difference. However, since the problem provides approximate numbers, it's reasonable to use 27,000 as the number of rebels for calculation purposes.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the difference as \"more than 98,000,\" considering that there are over 27,000 rebels.\n\nBut perhaps the expected answer is just the difference between 125,000 and 27,000, which is 98,000.\n\nLet me check if there's any other information in the text that could help me get a more precise number.\n\nLooking back, it says that on April 4, the rebels were routed after causing heavy casualties. But it doesn't provide exact numbers of casualties or changes in the number of fighters.\n\nAlso, it mentions that captured survivors and a traitor revealed that the fortress was out of food and gunpowder. But again, no specific numbers related to the troop counts.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

The population density was . There were 7,849 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 96.8% white, 0.7% black or African American, 0.6% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.5% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 0.6% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 23.4% were Germans, 22.3% were Americans, 13.6% were Irish people, and 11.0% were English people.How many percent were not english?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this census data here from 2010 for a county in the United States. It gives a breakdown of the population by various demographics. The question is asking for the percentage of people who are not of English ancestry.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what percentage of the population is of English ancestry. According to the text, 11.0% are English people. So, if 11.0% are English, then the rest must not be English.\n\nTo find the percentage that is not English, I can subtract the English percentage from 100%. That is:\n\n100% - 11.0% = 89.0%\n\nSo, 89.0% of the population is not of English ancestry.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The text provides ancestry breakdowns for Germans, Americans, Irish, and English, with percentages of 23.4%, 22.3%, 13.6%, and 11.0%, respectively. Adding these up:\n\n23.4% + 22.3% + 13.6% + 11.0% = 69.3%\n\nWait, that only accounts for 69.3% of the population. What about the remaining percentage? The text also mentions other races: 0.2% from other races and 1.5% from two or more races. However, ancestry and race are different categories, so these might not directly relate.\n\nPerhaps not all individuals identified with one of the listed ancestries, and some may have multiple ancestries or none of the listed ones. But based on the information provided, the English ancestry is 11.0%, so the percentage not English would indeed be 100% minus that.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Peace was finally concluded in Edirne in 1568, and renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591. War would not again break out between the Habsburgs and Ottomans until 1593, in the Long Turkish War. However, throughout this period of peace small-scale warfare continued, a conflict known as the \"Little War\" . No large armies or sustained campaigns were launched, but authorities on both sides continually struggled with hostile raiders and forays across the poorly-demarcated border. Both sides, however, desired that peace continue.How many years did these events span for?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about some peace agreements between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans, and there are dates mentioned: 1568, 1576, 1584, and 1591. Then it says war broke out again in 1593. There's also mention of a \"Little War\" during this time, but the main focus seems to be on these peace renewals. The question is asking how many years these events spanned.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what period is being referred to. It starts with peace concluded in Edirne in 1568 and was renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591. Then, war started again in 1593. So, the period of peace and renewals stretches from 1568 to 1593.\n\nTo find out how many years this spanned, I should calculate the difference between 1593 and 1568.\n\nLet me do the math: 1593 minus 1568 equals 25 years. So, the peace agreements and their renewals spanned over 25 years.\n\nBut, I should consider if the peace started in 1568 and war began again in 1593, does that include both end years? Meaning, from the year 1568 to the year 1593, how many years is that?\n\nIf I count inclusively, from 1568 to 1593, that would be 1593 - 1568 = 25 years, plus one more year to include both starting and ending years, making it 26 years. But that might not be correct because when we calculate the span between years, we usually consider the difference between the dates.\n\nFor example, if something starts in January 1568 and ends in December 1593, that's 25 full years plus a bit, but in terms of spanning, it's typically considered 25 years.\n\nAlternatively, if it started in 1568 and ended in 1593, and we're counting the years in between, it would be 1568, 1569, ..., up to 1593, which is 26 years.\n\nWait, let's think differently. If an event starts in year A and ends in year B, the number of years it spans is B - A + 1.\n\nSo, 1593 - 1568 + 1 = 26 years.\n\nBut in terms of duration, it's 25 years. This is a common confusion.\n\nLet me check with smaller numbers to verify.\n\nSuppose an event starts in 2000 and ends in 2005.\n\nThe span is 2005 - 2000 = 5 years, but it includes both 2000 and 2005, so it's 6 years in total.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, 2005 - 2000 = 5, but if you include both starting and ending years, it's 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, which is 6 years.\n\nSo, the formula is B - A + 1.\n\nTherefore, from 1568 to 1593, it's 1593 - 1568 + 1 = 26 years.\n\nBut, in terms of duration, it's 25 years.\n\nHowever, the question is about how many years these events spanned.\n\nGiven that, I think 26 years is the correct answer.\n\nBut I need to consider the context. The peace was concluded in 1568 and war broke out again in 1593. So, the peace period is from 1568 to 1592 (since 1593 is when the war started again).\n\nTherefore, from 1568 to 1592 is 1592 - 1568 = 24 years.\n\nBut according to the earlier formula, it should be 1592 - 1568 + 1 = 25 years.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look at it differently.\n\nIf peace was concluded in 1568 and renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591, and then war\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 77.7 males.How many percent were not from 45 to 64?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this demographic data for a city, and I need to figure out what percentage of the population isn't between 45 and 64 years old. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, it says that the population is broken down into different age groups:\n\n- Under 18: 28.1%\n\n- 18 to 24: 9.2%\n\n- 25 to 44: 26.2%\n\n- 45 to 64: 21.4%\n\n- 65 and over: 15.1%\n\nAnd the median age is 36 years. Also, there's some information about the sex ratio, but I don't think that's relevant for this particular question.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of people who are not between 45 and 64 years old. So, basically, I need to find everything else except the 21.4% that's in the 45 to 64 age group.\n\nOne way to approach this is to subtract the percentage of the 45 to 64 age group from 100%. Because the total population is 100%, and removing the portion that's 45 to 64 should give me the portion that's not in that age group.\n\nSo, 100% - 21.4% = 78.6%\n\nAlternatively, I could add up the percentages of all the other age groups:\n\nUnder 18: 28.1%\n\n18 to 24: 9.2%\n\n25 to 44: 26.2%\n\n65 and over: 15.1%\n\nAdding those up: 28.1 + 9.2 + 26.2 + 15.1\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n28.1 + 9.2 = 37.3\n\n37.3 + 26.2 = 63.5\n\n63.5 + 15.1 = 78.6%\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result: 78.6%.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll make sure that all the age groups add up to 100%.\n\nUnder 18: 28.1%\n\n18 to 24: 9.2%\n\n25 to 44: 26.2%\n\n45 to 64: 21.4%\n\n65 and over: 15.1%\n\nAdding all of these together: 28.1 + 9.2 + 26.2 + 21.4 + 15.1\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n28.1 + 9.2 = 37.3\n\n37.3 + 26.2 = 63.5\n\n63.5 + 21.4 = 84.9\n\n84.9 + 15.1 = 100%\n\nYes, that checks out. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:A global survey done by Pewglobal indicated that at (as of 2014) least 33 surveyed countries have a positive view (50% or above) of the United States. With the top ten most positive countries being Philippines (92%), Israel (84%), South Korea (82%), Kenya (80%), El Salvador (80%), Italy (78%), Ghana (77%), Vietnam (76%), Bangladesh (76%), and Tanzania (75%). While 10 surveyed countries have the most negative view (Below 50%) of the United States. With the countries being Egypt (10%), Jordan (12%), Pakistan (14%), Turkey (19%), Russia (23%), Palestinian Territories (30%), Greece (34%), Argentina (36%), Lebanon (41%), Tunisia (42%). Americans own view of the United States was viewed at 84%. International opinion about the US has often changed with different executive administrations. For example in 2009, the French public favored the United States when President Barack Obama (75% favorable) replaced President George W. Bush (42%). After President Donald Trump took the helm in 2017, French public opinion about the US fell from 63% to 46%. These trends were also seen in other European countries.How many more people, in terms of percentage, viewed the United States positively in the Philippines compared to Egypt and Pakistan combined?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here based on a global survey about opinions of the United States. It gives percentages of positive views in different countries and asks for the difference in percentage points between the Philippines' positive view and the combined positive views of Egypt and Pakistan.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant percentages from the text. According to the text:\n\n- Philippines: 92%\n\n- Egypt: 10%\n\n- Pakistan: 14%\n\nThe question is asking for \"how many more people, in terms of percentage, viewed the United States positively in the Philippines compared to Egypt and Pakistan combined.\"\n\nSo, I need to calculate the combined positive view percentage of Egypt and Pakistan, and then find the difference between the Philippines' positive view and that combined percentage.\n\nFirst, let's add Egypt and Pakistan's positive views:\n\nEgypt: 10%\n\nPakistan: 14%\n\nCombined: 10% + 14% = 24%\n\nNow, the Philippines has 92% positive view. So, the difference is:\n\n92% - 24% = 68%\n\nTherefore, the Philippines has 68 percentage points more positive views compared to the combined positive views of Egypt and Pakistan.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"how many more people, in terms of percentage,\" which suggests it's about percentage points, not proportions. So, 68 percentage points is the answer.\n\nI should make sure that I'm interpreting \"percentage\" correctly here. In statistics, a percentage point difference is the difference between two percentages. For example, going from 40% to 45% is a 5 percentage point increase.\n\nIn this case, since we're dealing with positive view percentages, and the question is about \"how many more people, in terms of percentage,\" it's safe to assume they mean percentage points.\n\nAlso, just to double-check, the question is not asking for a percentage of a percentage or any proportional change; it's directly asking for the difference in percentage points.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement: Hoping to snap a two-game losing streak, the Jets went home for a Week 6 AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills.  Both teams began the first quarter with field goals, as Bills kicker Rian Lindell made a 33-yard field goal and Jets kicker Jay Feely getting a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York soared into the lead with Feely's 41-yard field goal and running back Thomas Jones' 71-yard touchdown run.  However, Buffalo rallied to tie the game in the third quarter with Lindell's 25-yard field goal and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.  After both teams failed to get any point in the fourth quarter, the game went into overtime.  Despite getting the ball to start off OT, the Jets failed to get any point out of their opening drive.  After a hard-fought period, the Bills would emerge on top as Lindell booted the game-winning 47-yard field goal. Thomas Jones would have a career day as he ran 22 times for a franchise-best 210 yards (in addition to his rushing touchdown).how many yards did Fitzpatrick pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Jets and the Buffalo Bills. It's from way back in Week 6 of the season, and it's an AFC East duel. The Jets were trying to break a two-game losing streak. Let's see what happened in the game.\n\nFirst quarter: Both teams scored field goals. The Bills' kicker, Rian Lindell, made a 33-yard field goal, and the Jets' kicker, Jay Feely, made a 23-yard field goal. So, after the first quarter, it's probably 3-3, assuming each field goal is worth 3 points.\n\nMoving to the second quarter: The Jets scored again with Feely's 41-yard field goal, and then Thomas Jones had a 71-yard touchdown run. A touchdown is worth 6 points, and usually, they go for the extra point to make it 7 points total. But sometimes, teams might go for a two-point conversion, but I think the default is one point for the extra kick.\n\nSo, Feely's 41-yard field goal adds another 3 points for the Jets, making it 6-3, Jets leading. Then, Jones' 71-yard touchdown run would be 6 points, plus the extra point, making it 7 points. So, the Jets should be up by 10-3 or something like that.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm. Initial score after first quarter: 3-3. Then, Feely's field goal: 6-3. Then, Jones' touchdown: 6 + 7 = 13, so 13-3. Is that right? But the paragraph says they soared into the lead with Feely's 41-yard field goal and Jones' 71-yard touchdown run. So, yeah, they should be up by a significant margin at this point.\n\nThen, in the third quarter, the Bills rallied to tie the game. Lindell made a 25-yard field goal, so that would be 13-6. Then, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans. Touchdown is 6 points, plus the extra point would make it 13-13.\n\nWait, but the paragraph doesn't specify if the extra point was successful. In football, after a touchdown, teams can kick an extra point for one or go for a two-point conversion. If they make the extra point, it's +1, making it 13-13. If they miss, it's still 13-12. I think usually, extra points are pretty reliable, so probably 13-13.\n\nThen, in the fourth quarter, neither team scored, so it stayed 13-13, leading to overtime.\n\nIn overtime, both teams failed to score on their initial drives, and finally, the Bills' Lindell kicked a 47-yard field goal to win the game. So, final score is 16-13 for Buffalo.\n\nNow, the question is: \"How many yards did Fitzpatrick pass?\" Specifically, it's asking about Ryan Fitzpatrick's passing yards.\n\nFrom the paragraph, it mentions that Fitzpatrick threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Lee Evans. However, it doesn't specify if that was his only pass of the game or if he had other passes as well.\n\nIn football, the total passing yards for a quarterback include all the yards from his completed passes, not just the touchdown passes. So, if Fitzpatrick only had that one pass, which was 37 yards, then his total passing yards would be 37. But it's unlikely that a quarterback would only throw one pass in a game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the paragraph is only mentioning the notable pass he had, and he had other passes as well. But without additional information, it's impossible to know his total passing yards for the game.\n\nGiven the information provided, the only pass mentioned for Fitzpatrick is the 37-yard touchdown pass. Therefore, assuming that's his only pass, his total passing yards would be 37.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as quarterbacks usually throw multiple passes in a game. Maybe the paragraph is summarizing the key scores and not detailing every single play. So, perhaps Fitzpatrick had other passes that aren't mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the yards from the mentioned pass, and assuming that's his only pass in this context.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with 37 yards as his total passing yards for this game.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other information implied.\n\nThe paragraph states: \"Fitzpatrick's 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.\" It doesn't mention any other passes, so perhaps for the purposes\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:For the second time this season, the Eagles will wear their black uniforms as they host the Arizona Cardinals, who clinched a playoff spot after a Week 14 victory against Minnesota. The Cardinals didn't let up, as they mercilessly beat the Eagles 40-17. Rookie back David Johnson had a breakout game at an inconvenient time for the Eagles, as he scored 3 touchdowns and over 200 all-purpose yards to  A win from the Redskins put the Eagles 2 games down in the East, which they could easily fix by beating the Redskins the following week.How many points did the Eagles lose by?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about a football game between the Eagles and the Arizona Cardinals. It says that the Cardinals beat the Eagles 40-17. And the question is, how many points did the Eagles lose by?\n\nOkay, so to find out how many points the Eagles lost by, I need to find the difference between the Cardinals' score and the Eagles' score. The Cardinals scored 40 points, and the Eagles scored 17 points. So, I think I just need to subtract the Eagles' score from the Cardinals' score.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPoints lost by = Cardinals' score - Eagles' score\n\nSo, that's 40 - 17.\n\nNow, 40 minus 17. Let's see, 40 minus 10 is 30, and then 30 minus 7 is 23. So, 40 - 17 = 23.\n\nWait, but I should check that again because sometimes I make mistakes with subtraction. Maybe I can do it another way. If I think about it, 17 plus 23 is 40. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the difference is 23 points.\n\nSo, the Eagles lost by 23 points.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other way to interpret this. The text says the Cardinals beat the Eagles 40-17, so definitely, it's 40 minus 17.\n\nAlso, it mentions that the Eagles were wearing their black uniforms, and it's the second time this season they're wearing them. But that doesn't affect the score difference.\n\nIt also talks about a rookie back named David Johnson having a breakout game, scoring 3 touchdowns and over 200 all-purpose yards, which sounds impressive, but again, that doesn't change the score difference.\n\nLastly, it mentions that a win from the Redskins put the Eagles two games down in the East, but that's irrelevant to calculating the point difference in this game.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Giants flew to Ford Field for a Week 11 intraconference duel with the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, New York took the early lead as kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead as QB Eli Manning completed a 10-yard TD pass to RB Brandon Jacobs for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, the Lions got on the board as kicker Jason Hanson made a 42-yard field goal.  New York would reply with Tynes kicking a 46-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants improved their lead as Tynes made a 20-yard field goal.  Detroit's QB Jon Kitna completed a 35-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. LB Mathias Kiwanuka suffered a broken left fibula, ending his season.Which team had the lead at the end of the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this NFL game to analyze between the Giants and the Lions. It's Week 11, and they're playing at Ford Field in Detroit. Let's see what happened in this intraconference duel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the flow of the game by looking at each quarter and noting the scores. The question is specifically asking about the lead at the end of the third quarter, so I'll pay close attention to that.\n\nStarting with the first quarter: The only score was a 28-yard field goal by Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes. So, after the first quarter, the score is Giants 3, Lions 0.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter: The Giants increased their lead with a touchdown pass from QB Eli Manning to RB Brandon Jacobs, covering 10 yards. No other scores are mentioned for this quarter, so the halftime score is likely Giants 10, Lions 0, assuming no extra points or two-point conversions, as the text doesn't specify.\n\nNow, the third quarter: The Lions finally get on the board with a 42-yard field goal by kicker Jason Hanson. In response, the Giants' Tynes kicks a 46-yard field goal. So, in this quarter, the Lions score 3 points, and the Giants add another 3 points. Therefore, the score at the end of the third quarter is Giants 13, Lions 3.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter to confirm: The Giants make another field goal, this one 20 yards by Tynes, adding 3 more points to their total, making it 16. The Lions score a touchdown with a 35-yard pass from QB Jon Kitna to WR Calvin Johnson. Assuming a successful extra point, that would be 7 points for the Lions, making the final score Giants 16, Lions 10.\n\nBut the question is about the end of the third quarter. So, based on the scores I've added up, it's Giants 13, Lions 3, meaning the Giants had the lead by 10 points at that point.\n\nWait a second, I should double-check if there are any other scores or if I've missed anything. The text mentions that Lions' Kitna throws a TD pass to Johnson in the fourth quarter, but no other scores are mentioned. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlso, there's a note about LB Mathias Kiwanuka suffering a broken left fibula, ending his season, but that doesn't affect the scoring, so it's just additional information.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Trying to snap a three-game skid, the Chiefs went home for a Week 12 AFC West rematch with the Oakland Raiders.  In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski managed to get a 25-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Chiefs regained the lead as rookie RB Kolby Smith managed to get a 10-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Oakland played catch-up as Janikowski kicked a 54-yard field goal.  Kansas City improved its lead before halftime as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders regained the lead with RB LaMont Jordan getting a 5-yard TD run.  The Chiefs would respond with Smith getting a 5-yard TD run.  However, in the fourth quarter, Oakland regained the lead with RB Justin Fargas getting a 14-yard TD run.  Kansas City tried to come back, but the Raiders held on for the win. With their fourth-straight loss, not only did the Chiefs fall to 4-7, but it snapped their nine-game winning streak against the Raiders.  This would be the first time since 2004 that Kansas City had dropped four-straight games. Kolby Smith, in his first game starting in absence of Larry Johnson, had 31 carries for 150&#160;yards on the day.Which team led at halftime?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders. It's from Week 12 of the AFC West rematch, and the Chiefs are trying to snap a three-game losing streak. Let's see what happened in the game.\n\nFirst, it mentions that in the first quarter, the Raiders scored a 25-yard field goal by kicker Sebastian Janikowski, so that's 3 points for Oakland. Then, the Chiefs responded with a 10-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Kolby Smith, which is typically 6 points plus probably an extra point, making it 7 points for Kansas City. So after the first quarter, it seems like the Chiefs are leading 7-3.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter, the Raiders' Janikowski kicked another field goal, this time from 54 yards, adding another 3 points for Oakland, making their total 6 points. The Chiefs then improved their lead before halftime with a 30-yard field goal by kicker Dave Rayner, adding 3 points, so now it's 10-6 in favor of the Chiefs at halftime.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Initially, the Chiefs had 7 points from the touchdown and then added 3 more from the field goal, totaling 10 points. The Raiders had two field goals, each for 3 points, totaling 6 points. So yes, at halftime, the Chiefs were leading 10-6.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Raiders regained the lead with a 5-yard touchdown run by RB LaMont Jordan. A touchdown is 6 points, plus probably an extra point, making it 7 points. So, Oakland adds 7 points to their total, making it 13-10 in favor of the Raiders.\n\nThe Chiefs responded with another 5-yard touchdown run by Kolby Smith, another 7 points, bringing the score to 17-13 in favor of the Chiefs.\n\nThen, in the fourth quarter, the Raiders' RB Justin Fargas scored a 14-yard touchdown run, another 7 points, making it 20-17 for Oakland.\n\nThe Chiefs tried to come back but didn't succeed, so the Raiders won 20-17.\n\nBut the question is: Which team led at halftime?\n\nBased on my earlier calculation, the Chiefs were leading 10-6 at halftime.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there were any extra points or two-point conversions that might have affected the total.\n\nLet's think about it again.\n\nFirst quarter:\n\n- Raiders: 25-yard field goal \u2192 3 points\n\n- Chiefs: 10-yard TD run by Kolby Smith \u2192 6 points + extra point? Probably yes, so +1, total 7 points\n\nSecond quarter:\n\n- Raiders: 54-yard field goal \u2192 +3 points, total 6 points\n\n- Chiefs: 30-yard field goal \u2192 +3 points, total 10 points\n\nSo, at halftime, Chiefs 10, Raiders 6.\n\nBut in the third quarter:\n\n- Raiders: 5-yard TD run by LaMont Jordan \u2192 6 points + extra point, so +7 points, total 13 points\n\n- Chiefs: 5-yard TD run by Kolby Smith \u2192 6 points + extra point, so +7 points, total 17 points\n\nFourth quarter:\n\n- Raiders: 14-yard TD run by Justin Fargas \u2192 6 points + extra point, so +7 points, total 20 points\n\nChiefs didn't score anymore, so final score Raiders 20, Chiefs 17.\n\nBut again, the question is about the halftime lead.\n\nSo, at halftime, Chiefs had 10 points, Raiders had 6 points.\n\nTherefore, the Chiefs led at halftime.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I assumed the touchdown is worth 6 points and the extra point is worth 1. So, a touchdown plus extra point is 7 points.\n\nFirst touchdown by Smith: 7 points, making Chiefs 7-3.\n\nThen, Raiders kick another field goal: +3, total 6.\n\nChiefs kick a field goal: +3, total 10.\n\nSo, halftime: Chiefs 10, Raiders 6.\n\nBut in the third quarter, Raiders score a touchdown plus extra point: +7, total 13.\n\nChiefs score another touchdown plus extra point: +7, total 17.\n\nRaiders score another touchdown plus extra point: +7, total 20.\n\nChiefs didn't score anymore, so final score Raiders 20, Chiefs 17.\n\nBut again, the question is about the halftime lead.\n\nSo, the Chiefs led at halftime 10-6.\n\nWait, but the text says\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their hard-fought win over the Ravens, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football. There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, the Chiefs were attempting to re-claim the lead midway through the fourth quarter, when Smith was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. However, the Broncos went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. The Chiefs took a 24-17 lead six plays later, with running back Knile Davis rushing for an 8-yard touchdown with 2:27 left in the game. Manning then engineered a 10-play, 80-yard drive, culminating in a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanders with 36 seconds left. The game appeared to be headed to overtime, however, on the initial play of the Chiefs' ensuing possession, Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall forced a fumble off Charles deep in Chiefs' territory, and cornerback Bradley Roby returned the fumble 21 yards for a touchdown with 27 seconds in the game. The Broncos' defense subdued the Chiefs' last drive.How many interceptions did Talib have the week before?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Broncos and the Chiefs. It's a bit detailed, but I need to find out how many interceptions Aqib Talib had the week before this game. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The text is describing a game where the Broncos traveled to play the Chiefs in Arrowhead Stadium. It's an AFC West duel, and it was on Thursday Night Football. The game progressed through different quarters, and there were various scoring plays and turnovers mentioned.\n\nLet me read through the text carefully to find any mention of Aqib Talib and his interceptions.\n\nIn the first paragraph, it mentions that there was no scoring in the first quarter, and cornerback David Bruton forced a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. So, no mention of Talib here.\n\nMoving to the second paragraph, the Chiefs scored first with a 34-yard touchdown run by Charles. Then, the Chiefs added to their lead when Marcus Peters returned an interception off Peyton Manning for a touchdown. So, Manning was intercepted by Peters.\n\nNext, the Broncos responded with two touchdown passes from Manning\u2014one a 16-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders and another a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by Virgil Green just before halftime. It also mentions that this scoring play came after Alex Smith was intercepted by Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. It specifically says that was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks.\n\nAh, here it is. It says that was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. So, in the previous week, he had one interception. Because \"2nd pick in as many weeks\" means he had one interception in the previous week and another one in this game.\n\nWait, let me think about this. If it's his 2nd pick in as many weeks, that means he had one interception in the previous week and another one in this game. So, the week before this game, he had one interception.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many interceptions Talib had the week before this game. According to this, it was one.\n\nLet me check if there's any other mention of Talib's interceptions in the text. Later in the game, there's a mention of Smith being intercepted by Chris Harris Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. Then, the Broncos went three-and-out and punted.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their win over the Bears the Redskins flew to Ford Field for an NFC duel with the Lions. In the 2nd quarter the Redskins trailed early as QB Matthew Stafford got a 13-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. They pulled ahead with QB Donovan McNabb getting a 6-yard TD pass to RB Ryan Torain, followed by kicker Graham Gano making a 38 and a 46-yard field goal. The Redskins trailed slightly with Stafford getting a 2-yard TD pass to TE Brandon Pettigrew. The Redskins got the lead back with RB Keiland Williams getting a 5-yard TD run (With a failed 2-point conversion). The Lions replied with Stafford finding Johnson again on a 7-yard TD pass (With a failed 2-point conversion). After that, the Redskins took the lead again with WR Brandon Banks returning a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion) to put the Redskins up 25-20. They soon fell behind with Stafford throwing a 10-yard TD pass to Johnson (With a successful 2-point conversion as Stafford passed to WR Bryant Johnson). This was followed by kicker Jason Hanson making a 32-yard field goal, and with DT Ndamukong Suh returning a fumble 17 yards to the endzone for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion). With the loss, the Redskins went into their bye week at 4-4.How many games had the Redskins played after the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about the Redskins' football game. They played against the Lions and there's a bunch of scoring going on. The question is asking how many games the Redskins had played after this particular game, and they ended up with a record of 4-4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 4-4 means. In sports, especially in American football, a record like 4-4 typically means they have won 4 games and lost 4 games up to that point in the season. So, in total, they've played 8 games.\n\nBut let's double-check that. The problem says they went into their bye week at 4-4. A bye week is a break in the schedule, so the game before the bye would be their eighth game of the season.\n\nTo make sure, I can think about it step by step:\n\n1. They started the season and played game 1, let's say they won.\n\n2. Game 2, maybe they lost.\n\n3. Continue this pattern until game 8, which is the one mentioned against the Lions.\n\nAfter game 8, they have a bye week. So, yes, they would have played 8 games up to that point.\n\nBut the problem is asking for how many games they had played after the game, which is after game 8. So, after game 8, they have played 8 games.\n\nWait a minute, the question says, \"after the game,\" meaning after this particular game against the Lions, which was their eighth game. So, they have played 8 games in total up to and including that game.\n\nBut in sports, when we say \"after the game,\" it might be interpreted as having completed that game, so the total number of games played is 8.\n\nHowever, sometimes \"after the game\" could be interpreted as having just finished that game, so the next game hasn't started yet. But in this context, since it's followed by a bye week, and it's specified that they went into the bye week at 4-4, it's clear that game was their eighth game.\n\nSo, to answer the question: how many games had the Redskins played after the game? The answer should be 8.\n\nBut to make it explicit, perhaps the answer is 8 games.\n\nWait, the instruction is to put the final answer in \\boxed{answer}. So, I should box the number 8.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"after the game\" means prior to that game. But no, the way it's worded, \"they went into their bye week at 4-4,\" meaning after playing this game, they took a break.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off an impressive blowout of the Denver Broncos, the Texans packed up and traveled to Indianapolis to do battle with their division rival. Houston drew first blood with as QB Sage Rosenfels threw a 17-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter. The Colts responded to the TD with a 29-yard Vinatieri field goal. The Colts, who got off to a slow start in the 1st Quarter, scored three touchdowns in the 2nd quarter, a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai and two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark. In the 3rd quarter, the Colts continued to pull away from the struggling Texans. Clifton Dawson scored a 4-yard TD Run and Manning passed to Reggie Wayne for a 7-yard TD. In the 4th quarter, the Colts put in backups and QB Sage Rosenfels threw a 6-yard TD to Andre Johnson and Darius Walker rushed up the middle for the 2-Point Conversion. The Texans fell 38-15, ending their 2-game win streak and hopes for their first winning season.Which player caught the shortest measured passing touchdown in this game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Houston Texans and the Indianapolis Colts. It seems like it was an interesting match with a lot of scoring, especially by the Colts. The question is asking for the player who caught the shortest measured passing touchdown in this game. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the passing touchdowns mentioned in the text and note their yardages. Then, I can compare those yardages to find the shortest one and identify which player caught that pass.\n\nStarting with the Texans:\n\n- QB Sage Rosenfels threw a 17-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter.\n\n- In the 4th quarter, Rosenfels threw a 6-yard TD to Andre Johnson.\n\nSo, for the Texans, the passing touchdowns were 17 yards to Walter and 6 yards to Johnson.\n\nNow, for the Colts:\n\n- Peyton Manning threw two TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark in the 2nd quarter.\n\n- There's also a mention of a TD pass to Reggie Wayne for 7 yards in the 3rd quarter.\n\nBut wait, the two TD passes to Dallas Clark don't have yardages specified in the text. It only mentions \"two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark.\" Without specific yardages, I can't compare them to the other touchdowns. So, I'll have to assume that since their yardages aren't mentioned, they might not be relevant for finding the shortest measured passing touchdown.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any implication of their yardages. But since they aren't specified, I'll proceed with the ones that have measurable yardages.\n\nSo, the measurable passing touchdowns are:\n\n- Kevin Walter: 17 yards\n\n- Andre Johnson: 6 yards\n\n- Reggie Wayne: 7 yards\n\nNow, comparing these:\n\n- 17 yards (Walter)\n\n- 6 yards (Johnson)\n\n- 7 yards (Wayne)\n\nThe shortest among these is 6 yards to Andre Johnson.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other passing touchdowns with shorter yardages that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n- The Colts scored three touchdowns in the 2nd quarter: a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai and two Peyton Manning TD passes to Dallas Clark.\n\nHmm, the run by Addai was 2 yards, but it was a run, not a pass. So, it doesn't count for passing touchdowns.\n\n- In the 3rd quarter, Clifton Dawson scored a 4-yard TD run, and Manning passed to Reggie Wayne for a 7-yard TD.\n\n- In the 4th quarter, the Colts put in backups, and Rosenfels threw a 6-yard TD to Andre Johnson.\n\nAgain, the runs are 2 yards and 4 yards, but they are rushing touchdowns, not passing touchdowns.\n\nSo, among the passing touchdowns with measured yardages:\n\n- Walter: 17 yards\n\n- Johnson: 6 yards\n\n- Wayne: 7 yards\n\nThus, the shortest is 6 yards to Andre Johnson.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other passing touchdowns that might have shorter yardages that aren't specified.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- The two passes to Dallas Clark don't have yardages mentioned.\n\n- If these passes had yardages shorter than 6 yards, that could affect the answer.\n\nHowever, since their yardages aren't specified in the text, I have to work with the information provided.\n\nIn such cases, it's common to assume that if yardages aren't mentioned, they aren't relevant to the question or aren't required for the comparison.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Following a preliminary bombardment, the battle for Cebu City began on March 26, 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the United States Seventh Fleet's Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach, 4 miles  southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach.What date were rehearsal landings conducted in Leyte?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about some battle during World War II, specifically the battle for Cebu City. It mentions that the Allies launched something called Operation Victor II, and there was a lot of military activity involving ships and troops. The main question is about when rehearsal landings were conducted in Leyte.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully to find the relevant information. Let's see:\n\n\"Following a preliminary bombardment, the battle for Cebu City began on March 26, 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the United States Seventh Fleet's Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island.\"\n\nOkay, so it says that they staged out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier. And the battle began on March 26, 1945.\n\nSo, if the rehearsal landings were two days before March 26, 1945, then I need to subtract two days from March 26 to find the date of the rehearsals.\n\nLet's think about this. March has 31 days, so:\n\nMarch 26 minus one day is March 25.\n\nMarch 25 minus one day is March 24.\n\nTherefore, the rehearsal landings were conducted on March 24, 1945.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If March 26 is the day of the battle, and rehearsals were two days earlier, then yes, March 24 makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if there's any other mention of dates in the text that might affect this.\n\nFurther in the text, it says: \"the 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach, 4 miles southwest of Cebu City.

            "question": "Given the question statement:at Cleveland Browns Stadium, Cleveland, Ohio TV Time: CBS 4:05pm eastern The Ravens traveled to Cleveland, Ohio for an AFC North match-up with the Cleveland Browns.  The Ravens struck first with kicker Matt Stover getting a 32-yard field goal.  However, in the second quarter, their small lead was wiped out, as WR Braylon Edwards caught a 58-yard TD pass and QB Charlie Frye got a one-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, both sides stiffened their defenses and prevented each other from scoring.  In the fourth quarter, down by 2 points, McNair drove down the field to set Stover up for a 52-yard field goal. With 0:29 left in the 4th quarter the field goal provided the winning points.  Steve McNair passed for 264 yards. He threw no interceptions and completed 23 passes out of 41. Jamal Lewis rushed for 86 yards. The leading receiver was Derrick Mason with 7 completions for 132 yards. The defense sacked Brown's quarterback Charlie Frye seven times. The defense also had one forced fumble and an interception. With their third straight win, the Ravens advanced to 3-0.How many touchdowns did Cleveland score in the second quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this question to solve. Let's see what it's asking. The text is about a football game between the Ravens and the Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. It's an AFC North matchup, and it's being aired on CBS at 4:05 pm eastern time.\n\nSo, the Ravens traveled to Cleveland for this game. The text walks through the game quarter by quarter, describing the scoring plays. It says that the Ravens struck first with a 32-yard field goal by kicker Matt Stover. That would make the score 3-0 for the Ravens.\n\nThen, in the second quarter, the Browns managed to reverse that lead. It mentions that WR Braylon Edwards caught a 58-yard touchdown pass, and QB Charlie Frye had a one-yard touchdown run. So, that's two touchdowns scored by the Browns in the second quarter.\n\nMoving to the third quarter, both teams stiffened their defenses and didn't score anything. Finally, in the fourth quarter, the Ravens were down by two points. Their quarterback, Steve McNair, led a drive down the field to set up kicker Matt Stover for a 52-yard field goal with 0:29 left in the game. This field goal provided the winning points, so the Ravens ended up winning the game.\n\nThe text also provides some additional statistics: McNair passed for 264 yards with no interceptions, completing 23 of 41 passes. Jamal Lewis rushed for 86 yards, and Derrick Mason was the leading receiver with 7 completions for 132 yards. The defense had seven sacks, one forced fumble, and an interception.\n\nWith that background, the question is: \"How many touchdowns did Cleveland score in the second quarter?\" Okay, so I need to focus on the second quarter and count the touchdowns scored by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nFrom the text, in the second quarter, it says: \"however, in the second quarter, their small lead was wiped out, as WR Braylon Edwards caught a 58-yard TD pass and QB Charlie Frye got a one-yard TD run.\" So, there are two scoring plays mentioned for the Browns in the second quarter: a touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards and a touchdown run by Charlie Frye.\n\nEach of these is a touchdown, so that's two touchdowns scored by the Browns in the second quarter.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other scoring plays mentioned for the Browns in the second quarter. The text mentions that the Ravens had a field goal in the first quarter, then the Browns scored those two touchdowns in the second quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, the Ravens scored the winning field goal.\n\nNo other scoring plays are mentioned for the Browns, and specifically, in the second quarter, it's only those two touchdowns.\n\nSo, the answer should be two touchdowns.\n\nWait a minute, the question is about the number of touchdowns scored by Cleveland in the second quarter. I need to make sure that these are indeed the only touchdowns scored by the Browns in that quarter.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n\"however, in the second quarter, their small lead was wiped out, as WR Braylon Edwards caught a 58-yard TD pass and QB Charlie Frye got a one-yard TD run.\"\n\nThat's clearly stating that these are the only scoring plays by the Browns in the second quarter.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington.

San Diego forced the Chiefs into six turnovers, and they led 20-0 in the second quarter. Rivers completed 18 of 23 passes for 209 yards and two touchdown passes, but threw one interception in the red zone. Jackie Battle started at running back instead of Mathews. Battle was in 27 plays compared to Mathews' 21, and he had 15 carries for 39 yards with a team-high four catches for 42 yards. Most of Mathews work was in the fourth quarter when San Diego's victory was mostly already decided. U-T San Diego wrote that Mathews would have been expected to start were it not for his fumble against Atlanta the prior week. Nick Novak filled in for kicker Nate Kaeding, who was out with a groin injury, and made all three of his field goals.Which team lead in the second quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about a football game between the Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs. It says the Chargers won 37-20, and they started the season with a 3-1 record for the second year in a row. Interesting. So, the main question is, which team led in the second quarter?\n\nLet me read this carefully. \"San Diego forced the Chiefs into six turnovers, and they led 20-0 in the second quarter.\" Okay, so it's clear that San Diego, which is the Chargers, was leading 20-0 in the second quarter.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check the context around this sentence. It mentions that Rivers completed 18 of 23 passes for 209 yards and two touchdown passes, but threw one interception in the red zone. Then there's some information about the running backs, Jackie Battle and Mathews, and something about Kaeding being out with an injury and Novak filling in, making all three of his field goals.\n\nBut the specific question is about which team led in the second quarter. From the text, it's straightforward: the Chargers led 20-0 in the second quarter.\n\nI think that's the answer. It's pretty direct.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos donned their alternate orange jerseys and kicked off their 2011 season at home against their AFC West rival Oakland Raiders, the Broncos' first Week 1 home opener since 2004. The Broncos took an early lead in the first quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Raiders reeled off 16 unanswered points in the second quarter, with a 3-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jason Campbell to fullback Marcel Reece, followed by three field goals of 37, 21 and 63 yards by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, the latter of which tied the record for the longest field goal in NFL history. The Broncos responded in the third quarter, with kick returner Eric Decker returning a punt 90 yards for a touchdown, followed by a 30-yard field goal by Prater. The Raiders increased their lead in the fourth quarter, with a 1-yard touchdown run by Campbell. The Broncos tried to rally, with quarterback Kyle Orton throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back Lance Ball. However, Oakland would run out the clock.Who kicked more field goals, Matt Prater or Sebastian Janikowski?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Broncos and the Oakland Raiders. It's from way back in 2011, and it's their Week 1 game, which was a home opener for the Broncos. They were wearing their alternate orange jerseys, which sounds cool.\n\nAlright, so let's break down what happened in the game. The Broncos started off by scoring a field goal in the first quarter, 28 yards by Matt Prater. Then, the Raiders came back strong in the second quarter, scoring 16 points without the Broncos responding right away. Those 16 points included a touchdown and some field goals.\n\nSpecifically, the Raiders had a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jason Campbell to Marcel Reece, and then three field goals by Sebastian Janikowski: one from 37 yards, another from 21 yards, and an incredible 63-yard field goal, which tied the record for the longest field goal in NFL history. That's pretty impressive!\n\nSo, in the second quarter alone, the Raiders scored those 16 points, while the Broncos only had that one field goal in the first quarter. Then, in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to come back. They had a 90-yard punt return for a touchdown by Eric Decker, which is a lot of yards, and then another field goal by Matt Prater, this one from 30 yards.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Raiders added more to their lead with a 1-yard touchdown run by Campbell. The Broncos didn't give up and tried to rally with a 9-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Orton to Lance Ball, but ultimately, the Raiders ran out the clock to win the game.\n\nNow, the specific question is: Who kicked more field goals, Matt Prater or Sebastian Janikowski?\n\nLet's see. Matt Prater kicked two field goals: one from 28 yards in the first quarter and another from 30 yards in the third quarter.\n\nSebastian Janikowski kicked three field goals: 37 yards, 21 yards, and the famous 63-yard field goal.\n\nSo, comparing the number of field goals:\n\n- Matt Prater: 2 field goals\n\n- Sebastian Janikowski: 3 field goals\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

The Bengals started off the scoring in the first quarter when Randy Bullock kicked a 23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. The Steelers tied it up when Chris Boswell nailed a 45-yard field goal, leaving the score at 3-3, but the Bengals regained the lead late in the first quarter on Andy Dalton's 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 10-3. In the second quarter, the Bengals moved up by double digits as Jeremy Hill ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 17-3. The Steelers drew closer as Boswell made another field goal to make it 17-6, but Bullock put the Bengals back up by two touchdowns with a 23-yard field goal to make it 20-6. The Steelers closed the first half out with their third field goal of the game, as Boswell kicked a 49-yard effort to make the halftime score 20-9. Those three points would be the first three of 15 straight as they would shut out the Bengals in the second half, starting with field goals from 40 and 49 yards out to reduce the deficit to 20-15. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers moved even closer when Boswell kicked his sixth field goal of the game from 30 yards out to make it 20-18. They completed the comeback attempt when Ben Roethlisberger found Eli Rogers on a 24-yard touchdown pass with 7:29 remaining; however, the two-point conversion was unsuccessful, which made the score 24-20, which would end up being the final score. With the win, the Steelers improved to 9-5. The team also won five games in a row for the first time since 2009. The Steelers finished the season 5-3 away from home.How many points were the Bengals behind by haltime?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this NFL game summary between the Steelers and the Bengals. It's a bit lengthy, but I need to find out how many points the Bengals were ahead by at halftime. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scoring sequence in the first half. The summary mentions that the Bengals started off the scoring in the first quarter with a 23-yard field goal by Randy Bullock, making the score 3-0. Then, the Steelers tied it up with a 45-yard field goal by Chris Boswell, so it's 3-3. After that, the Bengals regained the lead with Andy Dalton's 1-yard touchdown run, which is typically worth 6 points plus possibly a extra point or a two-point conversion. The summary says the score became 10-3, so they probably went for the extra point.\n\nNext, in the first quarter, Jeremy Hill ran for a 4-yard touchdown, making it 17-3. Then, the Steelers kicked another field goal, making it 17-6. Bullock kicked another 23-yard field goal for the Bengals, making it 20-6. Finally, before halftime, Boswell kicked a 49-yard field goal, making the halftime score 20-9.\n\nSo, at halftime, the Bengals were leading 20-9. To find out how many points they were ahead by, I subtract the Steelers' score from the Bengals' score: 20 - 9 = 11 points.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is \"How many points were the Bengals behind by halftime?\" If the Bengals were leading, they weren't behind; they were ahead. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the question or in my understanding.\n\nLet me double-check the scoring. Starting at 0-0:\n\n1. Bengals: 23-yard field goal -> 3-0\n\n2. Steelers: 45-yard field goal -> 3-3\n\n3. Bengals: Dalton's 1-yard TD run -> 10-3\n\n4. Bengals: Hill's 4-yard TD run -> 17-3\n\n5. Steelers: Boswell's field goal -> 17-6\n\n6. Bengals: Bullock's 23-yard field goal -> 20-6\n\n7. Steelers: Boswell's 49-yard field goal -> 20-9\n\nYes, at halftime, it's 20-9, Bengals leading.\n\nSo, the Bengals weren't behind; they were ahead by 11 points. Maybe the question was intended to ask how many points the Bengals were ahead by at halftime.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 11 points.\n\nBut to match the user's exact question, which asks how many points the Bengals were behind by, the answer would be 0, since they weren't behind.\n\nHowever, that seems unlikely, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a part of the game where the Bengals were behind, but from the summary, it seems they were ahead at halftime.\n\nWait, let's check the entire game.\n\nAfter halftime, the Steelers scored three more field goals: 40 yards, 49 yards, and 30 yards, making the score 20-12, then 20-15, then 20-18.\n\nThen, Ben Roethlisberger found Eli Rogers for a 24-yard touchdown pass, making it 24-20, with the two-point conversion failing, so it's 24-20 final.\n\nSo, the Steelers came back in the second half, but the question is only about halftime.\n\nAt halftime, Bengals were leading 20-9.\n\nTherefore, the Bengals were not behind; they were ahead by 11 points.\n\nIf the question is how many points the Bengals were behind by at halftime, the answer is they were not behind, so 0 points.\n\nBut that seems like a trick question or a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to ask how many points the Steelers were behind by at halftime, which would be 11 points.\n\nGiven the information provided, the Bengals were ahead by 11 points at halftime.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Chiefs kicker John Carney managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City regained the lead as QB Damon Huard completed a 2-yard TD pass to DE Jared Allen. Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 2010, 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.3 percent were married couples living together and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0 percent had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.2 percent were non-families. The city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20. In 2013, the percentage of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent. Of Philadelphias adults, 31 percent were married or lived as a couple, 55 percent were not married, 11 percent were divorced or separated, and 3 percent were widowed.How many in percent of households weren't married couples living together?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here with a bunch of statistics about households in Philadelphia in 2010. The question is asking for the percentage of households that weren't married couples living together. Let's see what information is provided.\n\nFirst, it says that in 2010, 24.9% of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them. But I think that's besides the point for this question. The key data is about the types of households:\n\n- 28.3% were married couples living together\n\n- 22.5% had a female householder with no husband present\n\n- 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present\n\n- 43.2% were non-families\n\nAlso, it mentions that 34.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. But I need to find the percentage of households that weren't married couples living together.\n\nSo, if 28.3% were married couples living together, then the rest weren't. To find the rest, I can subtract this percentage from 100%.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n100% - 28.3% = 71.7%\n\nSo, 71.7% of households weren't married couples living together.\n\nWait a minute, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's any other category I need to consider.\n\nLooking back at the text, it breaks down the households into several categories:\n\n- Married couples living together: 28.3%\n\n- Female householder, no husband present: 22.5%\n\n- Male householder, no wife present: 6.0%\n\n- Non-families: 43.2%\n\nLet's see if these add up to 100%:\n\n28.3% + 22.5% + 6.0% + 43.2% = 100%\n\nYes, they add up to 100%, so that's good.\n\nNow, the question is asking for households that weren't married couples living together. That means all the other categories combined.\n\nSo, again, 100% - 28.3% = 71.7%\n\nAlternatively, adding up the other categories:\n\n22.5% (female householder) + 6.0% (male householder) + 43.2% (non-families) = 71.7%\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of households that weren't married couples living together is 71.7%.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let's look at the other information provided to see if it's relevant.\n\nIt mentions that in 2013, 56% of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months were unmarried. But that seems like additional information not directly related to the household composition in 2010.\n\nAlso, it provides data on the marital status of Philadelphia's adults in 2013:\n\n- 31% married or lived as a couple\n\n- 55% not married\n\n- 11% divorced or separated\n\n- 3% widowed\n\nAgain, this seems like additional information not directly related to the 2010 household data.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1574 the Captaincy General of the Philippines was created as a dependency of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1584, the Real Audiencia of Manila is established by King Felipe II, who appointed as its President the same governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. The Captaincy had its capital in Cebu from 1565 to 1595, and in Manila from 1595 until 1898. As part of the extensive governmental reforms during the early Bourbon period throughout the overseas possessions, an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree of July 17, 1784 that handled issues regarding the government finances and to promote the economy. Ciriaco Gonz\u00e1lez Carbajal was appointed as Oidor of the Audiencia of Manila and was instructed to abide by the Royal Ordinance of Mayors of 1782, that had been enacted in Rio de la Plata. Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu, and although they were created on November 24, 1786, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787. A month earlier, on October 23, the Intendencia of Manila had been attached to the Captaincy General of the Philippines. Until 1822, all General Captains were civilians, but after that year they were always chosen among the military. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, there were established many dependent local government offices and military settlements, very numerous due to a large number of islands and the extent of the districts.How many years did it take to abolish the Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about the history of the Philippines under Spanish rule, and there's a specific question about how many years it took to abolish certain Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key dates mentioned in the text regarding these Intendencias. The text says that an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree on July 17, 1784. Then, Ciriaco Gonz\u00e1lez Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu. These additional Intendencias were created on November 24, 1786.\n\nSo, the Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu were established in 1786. Now, I need to find out when they were abolished.\n\nLooking further in the text, I see that they were abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787. So, they were established in 1786 and abolished in 1787.\n\nTo find out how many years it took to abolish them, I need to calculate the difference between 1787 and 1786. That's just 1 year.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about the dates. Established on November 24, 1786, and abolished on November 20, 1787. So, from November 24, 1786, to November 20, 1787, is indeed approximately 1 year.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other information in the text that might affect this calculation. The text mentions that a month earlier, on October 23, 1787, the Intendencia of Manila was attached to the Captaincy General of the Philippines. But that seems separate from the abolition of the other Intendencias.\n\nAlso, the text mentions that throughout the second half of the 19th century, there were many local government offices and military settlements established, but that seems unrelated to the specific Intendencias in question.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to build on the momentum of their comeback win at Miami, the Broncos donned their alternate orange jerseys and returned home for an interconference duel with the Detroit Lions. The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with a 39-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Lions would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 41-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young, followed in the second quarter by a 50-yard field goal by placekicker Jason Hanson, a 1-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to tight end Tony Scheffler and a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Maurice Morris, giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead. The Lions continued their domination in the third quarter, with a 24-yard fumble return for a touchdown by defensive end Cliff Avril, a 56-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, followed in the fourth quarter by cornerback Chris Houston returning an interception off Broncos' quarterback Tim Tebow 100 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos finally got into the end zone, with Tebow throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in Detroit's favor.How many points ahead was Detroit going into halftime?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Broncos and the Detroit Lions. It's talking about scores in different quarters and trying to figure out how many points ahead Detroit was at halftime. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know what happened in each quarter. The text says the Broncos had an early lead in the first quarter with a 39-yard field goal by Matt Prater. So, that's 3 points for the Broncos.\n\nThen, the Lions started scoring. There was a 41-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Titus Young. A touchdown is worth 7 points, right? Because they can add a point after kick.\n\nWait, actually, I should confirm. In football, a touchdown is 6 points, and the extra point kick is worth 1 point, making it 7 in total if they make the extra point.\n\nSo, assuming they made the extra point, that's 7 points for Detroit.\n\nThen, in the second quarter, the Lions scored a 50-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. A field goal is worth 3 points.\n\nNext, a 1-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Tony Scheffler. Again, that's another 7 points if they made the extra point.\n\nAfter that, a 1-yard touchdown run by Maurice Morris. Another 7 points, assuming the extra point was good.\n\nSo, let's add up the scores for each team up to halftime.\n\nFor the Broncos:\n\n- 3 points from the field goal in the first quarter.\n\nFor the Lions:\n\n- 7 points from the touchdown pass to Young.\n\n- 3 points from the field goal by Hanson.\n\n- 7 points from the touchdown pass to Scheffler.\n\n- 7 points from Morris's touchdown run.\n\nNow, let's total those up.\n\nLions: 7 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 24 points.\n\nBroncos: 3 points.\n\nSo, at halftime, Detroit was ahead by 24 - 3 = 21 points.\n\nWait, but the text says \"a 50-yard field goal by placekicker Jason Hanson\" and \"a 1-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to tight end Tony Scheffler and a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Maurice Morris, giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead.\"\n\nOkay, so it explicitly says Detroit had 24 points and Broncos had 3 at halftime. So, Detroit was ahead by 21 points.\n\nBut the question is: How many points ahead was Detroit going into halftime?\n\nSo, the answer should be 21 points.\n\nWait, but the text says \"giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead.\" So, 24 minus 3 is indeed 21.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure there are no other scores in the first half that might be missed.\n\nLooking back, the Broncos only scored one field goal in the first quarter, and Detroit scored one touchdown in the first quarter and then a field goal and two touchdowns in the second quarter.\n\nYes, that adds up to 24 points for Detroit and 3 for the Broncos at halftime.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at  El Ksiba in April 1922.  Said was forced to flee, with much of the A\u00eft Ichkern tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas.  Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas.  Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to garrisons in Germany, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit.  Said never did so, dying in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade.  Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936.  Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comit\u00e9 d'Action Marocaine  in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951.  France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan Mohammed V and already fighting a bloody war of independence in Algeria, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956.How many years past from spring 1922 to when Said died?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about some events in Morocco back in the early 20th century. It talks about a guy named Said who was involved in some conflicts with Poeymirau and Freydenberg in 1922. Then, it says that Said was forced to flee to the mountains and later died in action against French troops in March 1924. The question is asking how many years passed from spring 1922 to when Said died.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the time difference between spring 1922 and March 1924. Spring 1922 would be around March or April of that year, since spring typically starts in March. So, if Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched their attacks in spring 1922, that would be roughly March or April 1922.\n\nSaid died in March 1924. So, from March 1922 to March 1924 is a period of two years. But let's make sure about the exact months.\n\nIf the attacks were in April 1922 and Said died in March 1924, that's still approximately two years. From April 1922 to April 1924 would be exactly two years, and since Said died in March 1924, it's one month short of two full years. But in terms of years, it's still two years.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Friedrich Engels wrote The Peasant War in Germany , which opened up the issue of the early stages of German capitalism on later bourgeois \"civil society\" at the level of peasant economies. Engels' analysis was picked up in the middle 20th century by the French Annales School, and Marxist historians in East Germany and Britain. Using Karl Marx's concept of historical materialism,  Engels portrayed the events of 1524-1525 as prefiguring the 1848 Revolution. He wrote, \"Three centuries have passed and many a thing has changed; still the Peasant War is not so impossibly far removed from our present struggle, and the opponents who have to be fought are essentially the same. We shall see the classes and fractions of classes which everywhere betrayed 1848 and 1849 in the role of traitors, though on a lower level of development, already in 1525.\" Engels ascribed the failure of the revolt to its fundamental conservatism. This led both Marx and Engels to conclude that the communist revolution, when it occurred, would be led not by a peasant army but by an urban proletariat.Which happened first, the Revolution, or the events of 1524-1525?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about Friedrich Engels and his work \"The Peasant War in Germany.\" It seems like it's asking about the timeline of events mentioned\u2014specifically, which came first, the Revolution, or the events of 1524-1525.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these events are. The text mentions \"the events of 1524-1525\" referring to the Peasant War in Germany. So, that's a specific time period in the 16th century. Then, it talks about \"the Revolution,\" which is referred to in the context of 1848 Revolution. So, there's a Peasant War in the 1520s and a Revolution in 1848.\n\nEngels wrote about the Peasant War in Germany, analyzing it in the context of the development of German capitalism and comparing it to the events of 1848. He used Marx's concept of historical materialism to interpret these events.\n\nThe question is straightforward: which happened first, the Revolution (1848) or the events of 1524-1525 (Peasant War)?\n\nWell, 1524-1525 is clearly before 1848. So, the Peasant War happened first, and then the 1848 Revolution.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing something. The text says, \"Engels portrayed the events of 1524-1525 as prefiguring the 1848 Revolution.\" So, the Peasant War is seen as foreshadowing or anticipating the later revolution. That reinforces that the Peasant War came first.\n\nEngels also wrote that \"three centuries have passed and many a thing has changed; still the Peasant War is not so impossibly far removed from our present struggle, and the opponents who everywhere betrayed 1848 and 1849 in the role of traitors, though on a lower level of development, were already in 1525.\"\n\nSo, he's drawing a connection between the two events, separated by three centuries, and seeing similar dynamics in terms of class struggle and betrayal.\n\nFurthermore, Engels attributed the failure of the peasant revolt in the 1520s to its conservatism and concluded that when the communist revolution occurs, it would be led by the urban proletariat, not the peasantry.\n\nGiven all this, the timeline is clear: the Peasant War in Germany occurred in 1524-1525, and the Revolution referred to is the 1848 Revolution. Therefore, the Peasant War happened first.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Having achieved religious independence, Bulgarian nationalists focused on gaining political independence as well.  Two revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers.How many years after the April Uprising was the Berlin Treaty signed?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text here about Bulgarian history, and there's a question at the end: \"How many years after the April Uprising was the Berlin Treaty signed?\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the dates of the April Uprising and the Berlin Treaty. According to the text, the April Uprising broke out in 1876. Then, it mentions the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which led to the Treaty of San Stefano, and then the Berlin Treaty.\n\nSo, the April Uprising is in 1876, and the Berlin Treaty is mentioned after the Russo-Turkish War, which was 1877-1878. I need to find out when exactly the Berlin Treaty was signed.\n\nFrom my general knowledge, I recall that the Berlin Treaty was indeed signed in 1878, after the Russo-Turkish War. So, if the uprising was in 1876 and the Berlin Treaty was in 1878, that would be a difference of 2 years.\n\nBut let me double-check the dates to make sure. The April Uprising is clearly stated as 1876. The Russo-Turkish War was 1877-1878, and the Treaty of San Stefano was likely signed in 1878 as well, following the war. Then, the Berlin Treaty, which revised the terms of San Stefano, was also in 1878.\n\nSo, from 1876 to 1878 is indeed 2 years.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2 years.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"how many years after the April Uprising was the Berlin Treaty signed?\" and I've calculated 2 years. But maybe I need to consider the exact months to see if it's precisely 2 years.\n\nHowever, the uprising was in April 1876, and the Berlin Treaty was signed in June or July 1878, I think. So, from April 1876 to June 1878 is about 2 years and 2 months, which is still approximately 2 years.\n\nIn historical contexts, especially when not specified, years are often considered in whole numbers. So, 2 years seems accurate.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the Treaty of San Stefano led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state, and then the Berlin Treaty partitioned the stipulated territory. So, there was an interval between these two treaties, but the key dates are 1876 for the uprising and 1878 for the Berlin Treaty.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider more precise calculations, as the question is asking for years, not months.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years.

This is the key data point to answer the question.\n\n                                ### Answer:\n                                The final answer in \\boxed{141}. \n\n\n                                # Example 2:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Coming off their home win over the Ravens, the Chargers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 13 AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Chiefs kicker John Carney managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City regained the lead as QB Damon Huard completed a 2-yard TD pass to DE Jared Allen. Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs. Also, CB Antonio Cromartie recorded 2 INT to bring his league-leading total to 8.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Due to a conflict involving the Orioles' schedule, the Ravens opened the regular season on the road against the Broncos in what would be the first time a defending Super Bowl champion team has done so since the Buccaneers in 2003 when they opened their regular season against the Eagles.  This would be a rematch of last year's AFC Divisional game. The Ravens drew first blood when Joe Flacco found Vonta Leach on a 2-yard touchdown pass to take the lead 7-0 in the first quarter for the only score of the period.  The Broncos would tie the game in the 2nd quarter with Peyton Manning finding Julius Thomas on a 24-yard pass to take the game to 7-7.  The Ravens moved back into the lead when Ray Rice ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make the score 14-7.  Peyton would find Julius again on a 23-yard pass to make the score 14-14 for another tie before the Ravens kicker Justin Tucker nailed a 25-yard field goal to make the score 17-14 at halftime.  In the 3rd quarter, the Broncos went right back to work as Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-17 lead followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.  Later on in the quarter, Peyton would find Demaryius Thomas on a 26-yard pass to increase the lead to 42-17.  The Ravens tried to rally a comeback in the last quarter, with Flacco finding Marlon Brown on a 13-yard pass to shorten the Broncos' lead 42-24 followed up by Tucker's 30-yard field goal to make the score 42-27.  However, the Broncos wrapped things up in the game when Peyton found D. Thomas again on a 78-yard pass to make the final score 49-27.  The Ravens began their season 0-1 for the first time under John Harbaugh as head coach and Joe Flacco as their starter.  They also lost their first regular season opening game since 2007 as well as becoming the 2nd straight defending Super Bowl champion team to lose their season opener.How many points did Broncos score in the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Ravens and the Broncos. It's from a while back, but I need to figure out how many points the Broncos scored in the third quarter. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the flow of the game and keep track of the scores as they happen in each quarter. The text provides a detailed play-by-play, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\nThe game starts with the Ravens scoring first. Joe Flacco throws a 2-yard touchdown pass to Vonta Leach, making the score 7-0 in favor of the Ravens in the first quarter. That's the only score in the first quarter.\n\nMoving to the second quarter, the Broncos tie the game. Peyton Manning throws a 24-yard touchdown pass to Julius Thomas, making it 7-7. Then, the Ravens take the lead again when Ray Rice runs for a 1-yard touchdown, making it 14-7. After that, Manning throws another touchdown, this time a 23-yard pass to Julius Thomas again, making it 14-14. So, it's tied again. Later in the second quarter, the Ravens' kicker Justin Tucker nails a 25-yard field goal, making the score 17-14 at halftime.\n\nNow, let's focus on the third quarter. This is the key part I need to analyze. The text says that in the third quarter, the Broncos went right back to work. Peyton Manning finds Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass, making the score 21-17 in favor of the Broncos. Then, Manning finds Wes Welker on two consecutive passes: one for 5 yards and another for 2 yards. I assume these are both touchdown passes, but I should confirm that.\n\nWait, the text says \"finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.\" So, yes, those were touchdown passes. So, two more touchdowns for the Broncos, making it 28-17 and then 35-17.\n\nAfter that, Manning finds Demaryius Thomas on a 26-yard pass, increasing the lead to 42-17. So, another touchdown there.\n\nSo, in the third quarter alone, the Broncos scored four touchdowns: one to Andre Caldwell, two to Wes Welker, and one to Demaryius Thomas. Each touchdown is worth 7 points, assuming they all went for extra points or two-point conversions, but the text doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's just the standard 6 points for a touchdown plus 1 point for the extra point, totaling 7 points per touchdown.\n\nSo, 4 touchdowns x 7 points each equals 28 points in the third quarter for the Broncos.\n\nWait, but let's double-check if there were any field goals or anything else in the third quarter. The text mentions only these touchdown passes for the Broncos in the third quarter.\n\nSo, 28 points in the third quarter seems to be the answer.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's make sure there are no other scores in the third quarter.\n\nThe Ravens scored in the fourth quarter with a touchdown pass from Flacco to Marlon Brown, making it 42-24, and then Tucker's 30-yard field goal made it 42-27. But that's in the fourth quarter, so it doesn't affect the third quarter scoring.\n\nSo, indeed, the Broncos scored 28 points in the third quarter.\n\nWait, but the final score is 49-27, and the Broncos had 42 points after the third quarter, and then they scored another touchdown in the fourth quarter, making it 49. So, in the third quarter, they went from 21 to 42, which is 21 points, not 28.\n\nHold on, now I'm confused. Let's re-examine this.\n\nAt halftime, the score was 17-14, Ravens leading.\n\nIn the third quarter:\n\n- Broncos: touchdown to Andre Caldwell (28-17)\n\n- touchdown to Wes Welker (28-17 to 28-17... wait, no, it should be 28-17, then another touchdown makes it 28-17 to 28-17... wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the text says: \"Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-17 lead.\" So, that's 21-17, Broncos leading.\n\nThen, \"followed up with finding Wes Wel\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

In September 1939 the price was reduced to 15 cents, where it stayed until the September 1947 issue, which was 20 cents.  The price went up again to 25 cents in May 1949; the digest-sized issues from September 1953 to September 1954 were 35 cents.  The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95.  The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95.  The Terminus Weird Tales began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue.  The next price increase was to $5.95, in Spring 2003, and then to $6.99 with the January 2008 issue.  The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each.How many dollars would it have cost to buy the first paperback edited by Lin Carter, the second Bellerophon issue and the Fall 1988 issue of the Terminus Weird Tales?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about the prices of different issues of Weird Tales magazine, and I need to figure out how much it would cost to buy specific issues. Specifically, I need to find the total cost of the first paperback edited by Lin Carter, the second Bellerophon issue, and the Fall 1988 issue of the Terminus Weird Tales.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the prices of each of these issues based on the information provided.\n\nStarting with the paperbacks edited by Lin Carter:\n\nThe text says: \"The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95.\"\n\nSo, the first paperback edited by Lin Carter costs $2.50.\n\nNext, the Bellerophon issues:\n\n\"The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95.\"\n\nSo, the first Bellerophon issue is $2.50, and the second is $2.95.\n\nNow, the Terminus Weird Tales:\n\n\"the Terminus Weird Tales began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue.\"\n\nSo, the Fall 1988 issue is $4.00.\n\nNow, I need to add up the costs of these three specific issues:\n\n- First paperback by Lin Carter: $2.50\n\n- Second Bellerophon issue: $2.95\n\n- Fall 1988 Terminus Weird Tales: $4.00\n\nAdding these together:\n\n$2.50 + $2.95 + $4.00\n\nFirst, add $2.50 and $2.95:\n\n$2.50 + $2.95 = $5.45\n\nThen add $4.00:\n\n$5.45 + $4.00 = $9.45\n\nSo, the total cost would be $9.45.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I have the correct prices for each issue.\n\nFirst paperback by Lin Carter: Yes, it's $2.50, as the first three were $2.50, and the fourth was $2.95.\n\nSecond Bellerophon issue: The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95, so the second one is $2.95.\n\nFall 1988 Terminus Weird Tales: It says it was $4.00 for that issue.\n\nSo, adding them up again: $2.50 + $2.95 + $4.00 = $9.45.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The question is straightforward once I identify the prices of the specific issues mentioned.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos made their first visit to Tampa Bay since 2004. Cornerback Aqib Talib, who made his return to Tampa Bay where he played for the Buccaneers from 2018-2012, intercepted Buccaneers' quarterback Jameis Winston on the third play of the opening drive. The Broncos immediately capitalized, with quarterback Trevor Siemian throwing an 11-yard touchdown to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Buccaneers' next drive, a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston tied the game, which would be the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game. Following another interception of Winston by Talib, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. With 3:25 remaining in the first half, Siemian injured his non-throwing shoulder when he was sacked by defensive tackle Clinton McDonald, and backup quarterback Paxton Lynch, the team's first-round draft selection, took over in his NFL debut. Placekicker Brandon McManus added two field goals&#8212;a 38-yarder just before halftime and a 24-yarder midway through the third quarter. Lynch later threw his first touchdown pass&#8212;a 5-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders&#8212;which put the game out of reach. At the 6:52 mark of the fourth quarter, the game was delayed for an hour and a half due to a severe weather threat in the Tampa area.Which player scored the first rushing touchdown?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this question to answer: \"Which player scored the first rushing touchdown?\" from the given text about a football game between the Broncos and the Buccaneers.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully and identify the relevant information. The text describes a game where the Broncos visited Tampa Bay, and it mentions several players and events during the game.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The game is between the Broncos and the Buccaneers.\n\n2. It's the Broncos' first visit to Tampa Bay since 2004.\n\n3. Cornerback Aqib Talib, who used to play for the Buccaneers from 2008-2012, intercepted Jameis Winston twice.\n\n4. The first scoring play was a 11-yard touchdown pass from Trevor Siemian to Demaryius Thomas.\n\n5. Then, the Buccaneers tied the game with a 7-yard touchdown run by Jameis Winston.\n\n6. After another interception by Talib, the Broncos took the lead again with a 1-yard touchdown run by C.J. Anderson.\n\n7. Siemian got injured and was replaced by Paxton Lynch.\n\n8. Brandon McManus kicked two field goals.\n\n9. Lynch threw his first touchdown pass to Emmanuel Sanders.\n\n10. There was a delay due to severe weather.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the player who scored the first rushing touchdown.\n\nFrom the information above:\n\n- The first scoring play was a passing touchdown from Siemian to Thomas.\n\n- Then, the Buccaneers tied the game with a touchdown run by Jameis Winston.\n\n- Later, the Broncos took the lead with a touchdown run by C.J. Anderson.\n\nSo, the first rushing touchdown was scored by Jameis Winston.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. The sequence is:\n\n1. Broncos: Passing TD by Siemian to Thomas.\n\n2. Buccaneers: Rushing TD by Winston.\n\n3. Broncos: Rushing TD by C.J. Anderson.\n\nTherefore, the first rushing touchdown was indeed scored by Jameis Winston.\n\nI should check if there are any other rushing touchdowns mentioned before this. From the text, only these two rushing touchdowns are mentioned: one by Winston and one by Anderson.\n\nSo, the answer should be Jameis Winston.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"the first rushing touchdown,\" and according to the sequence, it's Winston's run.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's confirm if there are any other rushing touchdowns before this.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n- Opening drive: Interception by Talib, then Broncos score a passing TD.\n\n- Next drive: Buccaneers tie the game with a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston.\n\n- Then, another interception by Talib, followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by C.J. Anderson.\n\n- No other rushing touchdowns are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the first rushing touchdown was scored by Jameis Winston.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about the first rushing touchdown, and Winston is the Buccaneers' quarterback, while Anderson is the Broncos' running back.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify which team's touchdown; it just asks for the first rushing touchdown.\n\nGiven that, Winston's 7-yard run was the first rushing touchdown of the game.\n\nAfter that, Anderson scored a rushing touchdown as well.\n\nSo, the answer should be Jameis Winston.\n\nBut, to make sure, perhaps there's another touchdown run before this that I missed.\n\nLet me read the text again:\n\n\"the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game.\"\n\nWait, no, that's after the Broncos' second touchdown.\n\nWait, it says: \"the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game.\"\n\nBut earlier, it says: \"a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston tied the game.\"\n\nSo, if that's the only scoring play by the Buccaneers, then that must be the only rushing touchdown.\n\nBut later, C.J. Anderson scores another rushing touchdown for the Broncos.\n\nBut the question is about the first rushing touchdown.\n\nSo, Winston's 7-yard run was the first rushing touchdown.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Jameis Winston.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, perhaps there's some confusion in the text.\n\nLet me quote the relevant part:\n\n\"Following another interception of Winston by Talib, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back C.J. Anderson.\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. Broncos: Passing TD.\n\n2. Buccaneers: Rushing TD by Winston.\n\n3. Broncos: Rushing TD by Anderson.\n\nHence, Winston's touchdown comes before Anderson's.\n\nTherefore, Winston scored the first rushing touchdown.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Trying to end a three-game skid, the 49ers flew to Qwest Field for an NFC West rematch with the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.  In the first quarter, the Niners started off bumpy as Seahawks RB Shaun Alexander got a 3-yard TD run for Seattle's early strike and the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, San Francisco would get a field goal before halftime as kicker Joe Nedney nailed one from 39 yards out.  After a scorless third quarter, the Niners were in full force as QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to rookie TE Vernon Davis.  Afterwards, Smith would complete a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore.  Then, the 49ers wrapped the game up with Smith getting a very easy 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown.  Seattle would get one more score as QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 22-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens.  Fortunately, the Niners would get the win and the season sweep over the Seahawks.  With the win, the 49ers improved to 6-8How many yards longer was Alex Smith's longest touchdown pass than his shortest?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the 49ers and the Seahawks. It's talking about touchdowns and yardages, and I need to find out how many yards longer Alex Smith's longest touchdown pass was compared to his shortest. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the touchdown passes that Alex Smith made in this game. According to the text, there were a few scoring plays mentioned involving Smith.\n\nStarting with the first quarter: Shaun Alexander got a 3-yard TD run for Seattle. That's not Smith.\n\nIn the second quarter, the 49ers got a field goal from Joe Nedney, 39 yards. That's not a touchdown pass.\n\nThird quarter was scoreless, so nothing there.\n\nNow, in the fourth quarter, the Niners came alive. It says: \"the Niners were in full force as QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to rookie TE Vernon Davis.\" So, that's one touchdown pass by Smith, 8 yards.\n\nThen, \"Smith would complete a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore.\" So, another touchdown pass, this one 20 yards.\n\nAnd finally, \"Smith would get a very easy 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown.\" Hmm, is a QB sneak considered a pass? I think a QB sneak is a running play where the quarterback rushes the ball himself, not a pass. So, maybe this doesn't count as a touchdown pass.\n\nWait, but the text says \"Smith would get a very easy 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown.\" It doesn't specify if it's a pass or a run. But typically, a QB sneak is a run. So, perhaps this isn't a passing touchdown.\n\nLet me check again. It says \"QB sneak for a touchdown.\" I think that's a running play, not a pass.\n\nSo, Smith's touchdown passes are:\n\n- 8-yard TD pass to Vernon Davis\n\n- 20-yard TD pass to Frank Gore\n\nThe QB sneak might be a running touchdown, not a pass.\n\nAssuming that, his touchdown passes are just those two: 8 yards and 20 yards.\n\nSo, his shortest TD pass is 8 yards, and his longest is 20 yards.\n\nTo find out how many yards longer the longest was than the shortest, I subtract the shortest from the longest: 20 - 8 = 12 yards.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Cincinnati had a number of offensive weapons, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Wide receiver Eddie Brown (wide receiver) was the top receiver on the team, with 54 receptions for 1,273 yards and 9 touchdowns, setting franchise records for most receiving yards in season, highest yards per catch average in a season (24.0) and most receiving yards in a single game (216 against the Pittsburgh Steelers). Wide receiver Tim McGee and Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman were also major threats, combining for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns. Rookie fullback Ickey Woods was their top rusher with 1,066 yards and 15 touchdowns, while also catching 21 passes for 199 yards and gaining a lot of media attention with his \"Ickey Shuffle\", a dance routine he did in the end zone to celebrate his touchdowns. Multi-talented running back James Brooks (American football player) was also a key contributor, gaining a total of 1,218 combined rushing and receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. And the Bengals offensive line was led by such Pro Bowl players as right guard Max Montoya and left tackle Anthony Mu\u00f1oz. Mu\u00f1oz was named the NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 8th season in a row. With all these weapons, Cincinnatis offense led the NFL in scoring (448 points), rushing yards (2,710), and total yards (6,302).How many wide receives scored touchdowns?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about the Cincinnati Bengals' offensive performance, and there's a question at the end: \"How many wide receivers scored touchdowns?\" Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who the wide receivers are in this text. It mentions two wide receivers: Eddie Brown and Tim McGee. So, there are at least two wide receivers mentioned here.\n\nLet me look at Eddie Brown's stats. It says he had 54 receptions for 1,273 yards and 9 touchdowns. So, he scored 9 touchdowns.\n\nNext, Tim McGee is mentioned along with Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman, and together they combined for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns. Wait, so McGee and Holman together have 9 touchdowns. But Holman is a tight end, not a wide receiver. So, I need to figure out how many of those 9 touchdowns were scored by McGee, the wide receiver.\n\nThe text says \"wide receiver Tim McGee and Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman were also major threats, combining for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns.\" It doesn't specify how many touchdowns each of them had, but since they're listed together, it's likely that the 9 touchdowns are shared between them.\n\nHowever, to find out how many wide receivers scored touchdowns, I just need to know how many of them have touchdown scores, not necessarily the exact number of touchdowns each had.\n\nSo, Eddie Brown scored 9 touchdowns, and Tim McGee is part of the combination that scored 9 touchdowns with Holman, the tight end.\n\nBut the question is about wide receivers, not including tight ends. So, Eddie Brown and Tim McGee are the wide receivers.\n\nNow, does Tim McGee have any touchdowns? The combination of McGee and Holman have 9 touchdowns, but without specifying how many each has, it's possible that McGee has some touchdowns.\n\nHowever, to be sure, maybe I should look for individual stats for McGee.\n\nWait, the text says that Eddie Brown had 9 touchdowns, and McGee and Holman combined for 9 touchdowns. It doesn't specify if those are separate from Brown's touchdowns or if it's inclusive.\n\nWait, no, it's separate. It's saying Eddie Brown had 9 touchdowns, and then McGee and Holman combined for another 9 touchdowns.\n\nSo, total touchdowns from wide receivers would be Brown's 9 plus whatever McGee had.\n\nBut since McGee is combined with Holman for 9 touchdowns, and Holman is a tight end, then the touchdowns scored by McGee would be part of those 9.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many McGee had.\n\nAlternatively, maybe McGee didn't score any touchdowns, and all 9 were scored by Holman.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given that McGee is a wide receiver and presumably contributed to the touchdown count.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to know if McGee scored any touchdowns.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nThe team's total touchdowns would be the sum of touchdowns from all players.\n\nBut the text doesn't provide the team's total touchdowns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at other players' touchdown counts would help.\n\nIt mentions rookie fullback Ickey Woods had 15 touchdowns, and James Brooks had 14 touchdowns.\n\nSo, Woods has 15, Brooks has 14, Brown has 9, and McGee and Holman have 9 combined.\n\nBut again, without knowing how those touchdowns overlap or not, it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the touchdowns mentioned are all scoring touchdowns, like touchdown passes.\n\nIn other words, maybe these are receiving touchdowns.\n\nLet me think.\n\nEddie Brown had 9 touchdowns, likely meaning touchdown passes he received.\n\nSimilarly, McGee and Holman combined for 9 touchdowns, probably also receiving touchdowns.\n\nWoods is a fullback, so his 15 touchdowns could be rushing touchdowns or receiving touchdowns.\n\nSimilarly, Brooks had 14 touchdowns, likely a combination of rushing and receiving.\n\nBut to focus on wide receivers, it's Brown and McGee.\n\nSo, Brown had 9 touchdowns, presumably receiving touchdowns.\n\nMcGee's touchdown count is not specified individually, but since he's a wide receiver and part of the combination that has 9 touchdowns with Holman, it's likely that McGee also had some touchdown catches.\n\nHowever, the question is \"how many wide receivers scored touchdowns?\" It's not asking for the total number of touchdowns, but rather how many different wide receivers had touchdown catches.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that Eddie Brown had 9 touchdowns, and Tim McGee is also a wide receiver who likely had some touchdowns, but it's not specified that he had any.\n\nWait, but he\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Just days after teammate Sean Taylor died of his injuries, the Redskins tried to snap a three-game skid at home against the Buffalo Bills. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. For the team's first defensive play, they would come out with only 10 players on the field, as their honor to Taylor. In the first quarter, the Redskins took the early lead as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got on the board as linebacker Angelo Crowell sacked quarterback Jason Campbell in his end zone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half as Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills drew closer as kicker Rian Lindell managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Later, the Redskins responded with running back Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When the Bills tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved the Bills 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards. Afterwards, the Bills ended the game with Lindell nailing the game-winning 36-yard field goal.Who kicked the most number of field goals?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills. It's a bit emotional because it mentions that one of the Redskins players, Sean Taylor, had passed away, and the team was trying to snap a three-game losing streak. There's a lot going on here, but I need to focus on who kicked the most field goals in that game.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who the kickers were for each team. From the text, it says that the Redskins had kicker Shaun Suisham, and the Bills had kicker Rian Lindell. So, it's between these two who kicked the most field goals.\n\nLet's go through the game quarter by quarter to count their field goals.\n\nIn the first quarter:\n\n- The Redskins took the early lead as Suisham kicked a 27-yard field goal. That's Suisham's first.\n\n- There's no mention of any field goals by Lindell in the first quarter.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter:\n\n- The Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. That's Suisham's second.\n\n- Later, the Bills got on the board with a safety from Angelo Crowell sacking Jason Campbell in the end zone.\n\n- Then, Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal before halftime. That's Suisham's third.\n\nSo, at halftime, Suisham has kicked three field goals, and Lindell hasn't kicked any yet.\n\nThird quarter:\n\n- The Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 38-yard field goal. That's Lindell's first.\n\n- Then, the Redskins responded with Clinton Portis's 3-yard touchdown run.\n\n- Finally, Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal to end the half. That's Lindell's second.\n\nSo, after three quarters, Suisham has three field goals, and Lindell has two.\n\nFourth quarter:\n\n- The Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yard field goal. That's Lindell's third.\n\n- Then, Lindell kicked another one from 33 yards. That's Lindell's fourth.\n\n- There was an attempt at a 51-yard field goal, but there were timeouts and a penalty, and finally, Lindell kicked a 36-yard field goal to win the game. That's Lindell's fifth.\n\nSo, let's tally them up:\n\n- Suisham: three field goals\n\n- Lindell: five field goals\n\nTherefore, Lindell kicked the most field goals in that game.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst quarter: Suisham 1\n\nSecond quarter: Suisham 2 more, total 3\n\nThird quarter: Lindell 2\n\nFourth quarter: Lindell 3 more, total 5\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be Rian Lindell.\n\nBut the question is a bit vague. It says \"who kicked the most number of field goals?\" It doesn't specify if it's in the game or in general. Given the context, it's probably about this specific game.\n\nStill, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility that Suisham kicked more in the game.\n\nNo, according to the description, Suisham had three field goals, and Lindell had five.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there were other kickers, but the text only mentions Suisham and Lindell as the kickers for their respective teams.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years. Including the loss to the Redskins on Monday Night, the Cowboys have played in a total of 75 Monday Night games and have an overall record of 43-32.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Chiefs kicker John Carney managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City regained the lead as QB Damon Huard completed a 2-yard TD pass to DE Jared Allen. Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs. Also, CB Antonio Cromartie recorded 2 INT to bring his league-leading total to 8.

The Chargers took a quick lead with QB Philip Rivers throwing a 58-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. The lead was extended in the second quarter by kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 25-yard field goal, followed by Rivers finding Jackson on an 11-yard touchdown pass. The Chargers continued to dominate with FB Mike Tolbert getting a 1-yard TD run, followed by Rivers connecting to Jackson on a 48-yard TD pass, then with Kaeding hitting a 39-yard field goal. The 49ers made their only score of the game with RB Brian Westbrook getting a 1-yard TD run. This game was also a blowout and San Diego improved to 8-6.How many more touchdowns did the Chargers score than the 49ers?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Chargers and the 49ers. It's their fourteenth game, and it was played on Thursday night. It's an interconference duel, which means they're from different conferences, like the AFC and NFC.\n\nAlright, so the text says the Chargers took a quick lead with QB Philip Rivers throwing a 58-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. So, that's one touchdown for the Chargers.\n\nThen, in the second quarter, the Chargers extended their lead. First, kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 25-yard field goal. That's a field goal, not a touchdown, so no touchdown there. Then, Rivers found Jackson again on an 11-yard touchdown pass. So, that's another touchdown for the Chargers.\n\nAfter that, the Chargers continued to dominate with a 1-yard TD run by fullback Mike Tolbert. That's another touchdown, making it three now for the Chargers.\n\nNext, Rivers connected with Jackson again on a 48-yard TD pass. That's another touchdown, so now it's four touchdowns for the Chargers.\n\nThen, Kaeding hit a 39-yard field goal. Again, that's a field goal, not a touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers finally made their only score of the game with a 1-yard TD run by RB Brian Westbrook. So, that's one touchdown for the 49ers.\n\nThe text says this game was also a blowout, and San Diego improved to 8-6.\n\nThe question is: How many more touchdowns did the Chargers score than the 49ers?\n\nSo, let's see. The Chargers scored four touchdowns, and the 49ers scored one touchdown.\n\nTo find out how many more touchdowns the Chargers scored than the 49ers, I need to subtract the number of touchdowns the 49ers scored from the number the Chargers scored.\n\nThat would be 4 (Chargers) - 1 (49ers) = 3.\n\nSo, the Chargers scored three more touchdowns than the 49ers.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The Chargers had four touchdowns: one 58-yard pass to Jackson, one 11-yard pass to Jackson, one 1-yard run by Tolbert, and one 48-yard pass to Jackson. That's four touchdowns.\n\nThe 49ers had only one touchdown: a 1-yard run by Westbrook.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

Of the 279 actively participating communists, 125 were killed in action, later more than 500 people were arrested. The government forces lost 26 men. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia from 1940 until the era of Perestroika and Glasnost in the Soviet history of the Estonian SSR the communist coup attempt was referred to as Tallinn Uprising of December 1, 1924 against the Yoke of the National Bourgeoisie Government of Estonia and described as an event in the series of World revolution.How many communists were killed in the Estonia coup of 1924?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about the attempted coup in Estonia in 1924. It was organized by the Comintern, which I know was the Communist International, an organization that promoted communist ideas internationally back in the day. So, this coup was supposed to be a big deal, but it failed. It happened on December 1, 1924.\n\nAccording to the text, there were 279 communists actively participating in this coup attempt. Out of these, 125 were killed during the action. Additionally, more than 500 people were arrested later on. On the government side, 26 men were killed.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many communists were killed in this coup attempt. From the text, it's clear that 125 communists were killed in action. But it also mentions that more than 500 people were arrested later. However, it doesn't specify how many of these arrested communists were killed afterward.\n\nBut based on the information provided directly in the text, the number of communists killed in action is 125. There's no mention of further deaths among those who were arrested. So, I think the answer should be 125.\n\nWait a minute, but the text says \"more than 500 people were arrested.\" It doesn't specify how many of them were communists, but probably most of them were involved in some way. However, since it doesn't provide specifics on how many were killed after arrest, I shouldn't assume anything beyond what's stated.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After defeating the Bears in their season opener, the Packers faced the 0-1 Cincinnati Bengals in a week 2 contest at Lambeau Field. During the week leading up to the game, Bengals star wide receiver Chad Ochocinco said in an interview that he'll do a celebratory \"Lambeau Leap\" into the end zone seats if he scores in Sunday's game at Lambeau Field. The Packers started the contest with the ball, but could only manage to move the ball to mid field before they settled for a punt. The Bengals offense then took to the field at their own 37-yard line and after moving the ball into the Packers red zone, Carson Palmer managed to hit Laveranues Coles on a short 5-yard pass in the center of the end zone to take an early 7-0 lead. The Packers managed to match the Bengals drive though, by capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 3-yard pass by Aaron Rodgers to Donald Driver along the right sideline of the end zone. The score was now tied a 7-7. The Bengals regained possession after the Packers touchdown, but on the first play of their corresponding drive Carson Palmer attempted a pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco along the right sideline, but Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in front of Ochocinco and intercepted the attempted pass. Woodson then returned the ball down to the Bengals 11-yard line for a return of 22 yards. Two plays later, Packers running back Ryan Grant scored a touchdown on a 4-yard run outside of the left guard to take a 14-7 lead. After the Grant touchdown, both teams exchanged possessions into the second quarter. On the Bengals second drive after the Ryan Grant touchdown run, quarterback Carson Palmer capped the Bengals drive with a 1-yard sneak up the middle for a touchdown to re-tie the contest at 14-14. The Packers offense again sputtered and couldn't find the rhythm that the offense once possessed a season ago. After the punt, Carson Palmer was sacked for a loss of 8 yards and then on the next play Charles Woodson intercepted another pass along the right sideline from Palmer and returned the ball 37 yards for the Packers first defensive score of the season to retake the lead 21-14. On the Bengals next drive though, they would then retake the lead again on a 5-yard Palmer pass to Chris Henry in the back of the end zone. The score was now tied 21-21. The Packers offense retook the field aiming to break the tie before halftime, but only could manage to give kicker Mason Crosby a 55-yard attempt in which he missed as the clock expired. The teams went into the half tied at 21. After the half, the Bengals offense took to the field first but was forced to punt. The Packers responded by moving the ball quite efficiently, but their drive came to an end when Ryan Grant fumbled after pulling in a short Aaron Rodgers pass. The Bengals then managed to capitalize on the Packers first turn over of the season by putting together a 12-play, 62-yard drive capped by another Carson Palmer touchdown pass, this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. After the touchdown, Ochocinco ran behind the endzone looking for a place to Lambeau Leap finally settling for a group of Bengals fans in the right corner of the endzone. Both teams exchanged possession without scoring through the end of the third quarter. With both teams unable to score into the fourth quarter, the Bengals finally converted a field goal with 2 minutes left in game. to take a 31-21 lead. After the field goal, the Packers took over and managed to get the ball into field goal range in which Packers coach decided to kick the field goal to decrease the lead to 7 needing an onside kick recovery to tie the game anyway. The Mason Crosby kick was successful and the Packers special teams unit then lined up in the onside kick formation. Mason Crosby kicked the ball the right side and the ball hopped right to Packers corner back Tramon Williams for the recovery. With 45 seconds remaining, The Packers offense took the field with no timeouts. Rodgers then completed a couple of passes and moved the ball past midfield with 16 seconds remaining. Rodgers then completed a 25-yard strike to Donald Driver in the center of the field for 25 yards down to the Bengals 10-yard line. Hurrying down field the Packers snapped the ball with 1 second remaining but the Packers were flagged for a false start. With the penalty the remaining time was run off the clock and the game ended. What could have been a memorable comeback ended in defeat with the Packers suffering their first loss of the season 31-24 to bring their record to 1-1. This was the first time the Packers had lost to the Bengals at home. During the contest, Packers starting safety Nick Collins injured his shoulder and veteran starting left tackle Chad Clifton injured his ankle.How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the second?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Packers and the Bengals. It's kind of long and detailed, but I need to focus on the specific question: \"How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the second?\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the first and second touchdowns scored in the game. The text provides a play-by-play summary, so I'll have to read through it carefully to find the touchdown scores and their corresponding yardages.\n\nStarting at the beginning:\n\n- The Packers started with the ball but only managed to punt.\n\n- Then the Bengals got the ball at their own 37-yard line. They moved into the Packers' red zone and scored a 5-yard pass to Laveranues Coles for the first touchdown. So, the first touchdown is 5 yards.\n\n- Next, the Packers responded with an 11-play, 80-yard drive, ending with a 3-yard pass to Donald Driver for the second touchdown.\n\nWait, but according to the question, I need the first and second touchdowns. So, the first touchdown is the Bengals' 5-yard pass, and the second is the Packers' 3-yard pass.\n\nSo, the difference in yardage would be 5 yards minus 3 yards, which is 2 yards. So, the first touchdown was 2 yards longer than the second.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. Maybe there are more touchdowns scored later in the game, and I need to ensure I'm comparing the first and second scores correctly.\n\nContinuing to read:\n\n- After the Packers' touchdown, the Bengals got the ball again but were sacked for a loss, then intercepted. The Packers got the ball back and scored another touchdown, this time a 4-yard run by Ryan Grant.\n\n- Then, the Bengals scored again on a 1-yard sneak by Carson Palmer.\n\n- After that, Charles Woodson intercepted another pass and returned it for a touchdown, making it 21-14 Packers.\n\n- Then, the Bengals scored again on a 5-yard pass to Chris Henry, tying the game at 21-21.\n\n- In the second half, the Bengals scored another touchdown on a 5-yard pass to Chad Ochocinco.\n\n- Later, the Bengals kicked a field goal to take a 31-21 lead.\n\n- Finally, the Packers tried to come back but ran out of time, losing 31-24.\n\nOkay, so there are multiple touchdowns scored throughout the game. But the question specifically asks for the first and second touchdowns.\n\nLooking back, the first touchdown was the Bengals' 5-yard pass, and the second was the Packers' 3-yard pass.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 5 - 3 = 2 yards.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is referring to the first two touchdowns scored by one team, or perhaps in a particular half. I need to make sure I'm interpreting \"first\" and \"second\" correctly.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the second?\"\n\nGiven the context, it seems to be referring to the first and second touchdowns scored in the game, regardless of which team scored them.\n\nSo, first touchdown: Bengals, 5 yards.\n\nSecond touchdown: Packers, 3 yards.\n\nDifference: 5 - 3 = 2 yards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"first\" and \"second\" refer to the first two touchdowns scored by the same team. Let's check that.\n\nFor the Bengals:\n\n- First touchdown: 5-yard pass to Coles.\n\n- Second touchdown: 1-yard sneak by Palmer.\n\nDifference: 5 - 1 = 4 yards.\n\nFor the Packers:\n\n- First touchdown: 3-yard pass to Driver.\n\n- Second touchdown: 4-yard run by Grant.\n\nDifference: 4 - 3 = 1 yard.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to clarify what \"first\" and \"second\" refer to.\n\nPerhaps \"first\" and \"second\" refer to the order in which touchdowns were scored during the game, irrespective of which team scored them.\n\nSo, sequence of touchdowns:\n\n1. Bengals: 5-yard pass (first touchdown)\n\n2. Packers: 3-yard pass (second touchdown)\n\n3. Packers: 4-yard run\n\n4. Bengals: 1-yard sneak\n\n5. Packers: interception return touchdown\n\n6. Bengals: 5-yard pass to Henry\n\n7. Bengals: 5-yard pass to Ochocinco.\n\nSo, according to this sequence, the first touchdown is 5 yards, and the second is 3 yards.\n\nTherefore, the first touchdown is 2 yards longer than the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"first\" and \"second\" refer to the first two touchdowns scored by a particular team\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

In the first quarter the Saints took the early lead as kicker John Carney nailed a 31-yard field goal, followed by QB Drew Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Cardinals replied with kicker Jay Feely making a 37-yard field goal, followed by OT Levi Brown recovering a fumble and returning it 2 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter the Saints fell behind when Feely got a 44-yard field goal, followed the 4th quarter by Feely's 29-yard field goal. Then FS Kerry Rhodes recovered a fumble and ran 27 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. Then the Saints replied with Brees making a 35-yard TD pass to WR Robert Meachem, but had more problems when Brees' pass was intercepted by CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and returned 28 yards to the end zone for a touchdown.How many more field goals did Jay Feely have compared to John Carney?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Saints and the Cardinals. It's giving me a play-by-play of the scoring events and then asks how many more field goals Jay Feely had compared to John Carney.

So, I need to find the difference between Feely's field goals and Carney's field goals.\n\nFeely: 3 field goals\n\nCarney: 1 field goal\n\nDifference: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo, Feely had two more field goals than Carney.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure there are no other field goals mentioned that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n- Carney: one 31-yard field goal\n\n- Feely: one 37-yard, one 44-yard, and one 29-yard field goal\n\nNo other field goals are mentioned.

            "question": "Given the question statement:With Josh McCown getting the start at quarterback, the Raiders began their 2007 campaign at home in an interconference fight with the Detroit Lions.  After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Lions continued with their early lead as Kitna completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  Afterwards, the Raiders began to come back as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry, followed by RB LaMont Jordan getting a 12-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Detroit responded with Hanson kicking a 46-yard field goal, while Oakland took the lead with McCown completing a 7-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith.  However, as it seems to be for the Raiders, their lead wouldn't hold as the Lions scored 17 unanswered points (32-yard TD pass from Kitna to WR Shaun McDonald, Hanson getting a 23-yard field goal, and RB Tatum Bell getting a 14-yard TD run) to end the game.Which team had the most first half touchdowns?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Oakland Raiders and the Detroit Lions in 2007. It's talking about the first half touchdowns, and I need to figure out which team had the most in the first half.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes the first half of a football game. In American football, a standard game consists of four quarters: two in the first half and two in the second half. So, the first and second quarters make up the first half.\n\nLooking at the text, it says: \"After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.\" So, in the second quarter, which is part of the first half, the Lions scored a touchdown.\n\nThen, it says: \"Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal.\" So, in the second quarter, the Lions also kicked a field goal.\n\nNow, for the Raiders, it mentions: \"In the third quarter, the Lions continued with their early lead as Kitna completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, the Raiders began to come back as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry, followed by RB LaMont Jordan getting a 12-yard TD run.\"\n\nWait, but the third quarter is part of the second half, right? So, those scores don't count for the first half.\n\nSo, in the first half, only the Lions scored, with one touchdown and one field goal. The Raiders didn't score any touchdowns in the first half, according to this.\n\nBut let me double-check. The first quarter was scoreless, and in the second quarter, the Lions scored a touchdown and a field goal. No mention of the Raiders scoring anything in the first half.\n\nTherefore, the Lions had one touchdown in the first half, and the Raiders had zero touchdowns.\n\nSo, the team with the most first-half touchdowns is the Lions.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit tricky because it says \"which team had the most first half touchdowns?\" and the Lions had one, and the Raiders had none. So, the Lions had the most.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting a different answer, or maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me read the text again to make sure.\n\n\"It began their 2007 campaign at home in an interconference fight with the Detroit Lions. After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams. Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo, first quarter: no scores.\n\nSecond quarter: Lions touchdown and field goal.\n\nThird quarter: Lions another touchdown, then Raiders start scoring: a touchdown pass and a touchdown run.\n\nFourth quarter: more scoring, but that's in the second half.\n\nSo, indeed, in the first half, only the Lions scored, and that was one touchdown and one field goal.\n\nTherefore, the Lions had one touchdown in the first half, and the Raiders had zero.\n\nSo, the Lions had the most first-half touchdowns.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\nBut maybe the question is trying to trick me by mentioning multiple touchdowns in the game, but only one in the first half for the Lions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what \"first half\" means, but I don't think so.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\nThe final answer is the Lions had one first-half touchdown, and the Raiders had none.\n\nSo, the team with the most first-half touchdowns is the Lions.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the number, not the team.\n\nLet me check the question again: \"Which team had the most first half touchdowns?\"\n\nIt's asking for the team, not the number.\n\nSo, the answer should be the Lions.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should state that they had one touchdown in the first half, while the Raiders had none.\n\nYes, that would make it clear.\n\nSo, the Lions had one first-half touchdown, while the Raiders had none.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos played the Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game.  The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey.  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game. With this win the Broncos remained tied with the Chargers in the AFC West with a 6-2 record.How many yards difference was Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s touchdown pass compared to Jake Plummer 's first touchdown pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Broncos and the Steelers. It's talking about some touchdown passes and field goals, and it's asking for the difference in yards between Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass and Jake Plummer's first touchdown pass. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many yards each of those touchdown passes were. The question mentions that Jake Plummer threw a 16-yard touchdown strike to Rod Smith on the Broncos' first drive. So, Plummer's first touchdown pass was 16 yards.\n\nNext, I need to find Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass. Looking through the text, it says that Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game. So, Roethlisberger's touchdown pass was 15 yards.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference in yards between Roethlisberger\u2019s touchdown pass and Plummer's first touchdown pass. So, I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger one to find the difference.\n\nPlummer's pass: 16 yards\n\nRoethlisberger's pass: 15 yards\n\nDifference: 16 - 15 = 1 yard\n\nSo, the difference is 1 yard.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that there aren't any other touchdown passes mentioned for either quarterback that might be relevant. Let's double-check.\n\nFor Plummer, it mentions his first touchdown pass to Rod Smith for 16 yards, and then later, he throws a 10-yard touchdown pass to Javon Walker in the fourth quarter. But the question specifically asks for his first touchdown pass, which is the 16-yarder.\n\nFor Roethlisberger, there's only mention of one touchdown pass, which is the 15-yarder to Willie Parker. Later in the game, there are mentions of interceptions and another potential scoring opportunity, but in terms of touchdown passes, it only mentions that one.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Looking to secure their third straight win and another division title, the Patriots returned home to face the 7-7 Jaguars. After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game. With the win, the Patriots secured their first division title since 2007 and posted a 10-5 record heading into the final week of the season.Which team was leading the game going into the 3rd quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this game summary to read through, and I need to figure out which team was leading going into the third quarter. The teams are the Patriots and the Jaguars. The Patriots are trying to secure their third straight win and another division title. The Jaguars are 7-7 going into this game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the flow of the game. It starts with the Patriots receiving the opening kickoff. So, they begin their first drive. It was a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a first-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line, and it was recovered by the Jaguars' Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. So, the Patriots didn't score on that drive due to the fumble.\n\nNext, the Jaguars got the ball and moved to their own 35-yard line but failed to convert on a fourth-down attempt, so they turned the ball over to the Patriots. The Patriots then had the ball again. There was a 21-yard run by Morris, and then Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown pass. So, Patriots score first: 7-0.\n\nAfter that, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line but intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line, who returned it 56 yards. Then, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker, making it 14-0.\n\nThe Jaguars moved the ball a bit on their next possession, reaching midfield with some completions, but a false start penalty set them back, and they had to punt.\n\nPatriots then had a three-and-out, and on the Jaguars' next drive, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain, and the fumble was recovered by the Jaguars' Eben Britton, who punted again.\n\nPatriots then had a big play: a 55-yard run by Morris, and later scored on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run, making it 21-0.\n\nJaguars had another three-and-out, and Patriots extended their lead with a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss, making it 28-0.\n\nThat was the score at halftime.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Jaguars had a long drive: 16 plays, 69 yards, taking over eight minutes off the clock. But on a third-and-goal from the 5-yard line, Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line.\n\nPatriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive, ending with Brady throwing a touchdown to Moss again, making it 35-0.\n\nJaguars then moved the ball, scoring a touchdown with Garrard scrambling for a 2-yard run, making it 35-7.\n\nAfter that, the Patriots had a long drive: 20 plays, reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. They tried a fourth-down conversion but failed, turning the ball over on downs. Jaguars ran one play to end the game.\n\nSo, going into the third quarter, the score was 28-0 Patriots. But let's confirm if there were any scores in the third quarter before the end of the period.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Jaguars had that long drive that ended with an interception in the end zone, and then the Patriots scored another touchdown to make it 35-0.\n\nWait, but that touchdown was scored in the fourth quarter, not in the third quarter.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nThe third quarter: Jaguars had a long drive, ended with an interception, Patriots had a drive ending with a touchdown, but that was on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nSo, going into the third quarter, the score was 28-0 Patriots.\n\nBut let's make sure there were no scores in the third quarter.\n\nThe third quarter activities were:\n\n- Jaguars' long drive ending with an interception.\n\n- Patriots' drive ending with a touchdown, but that was in the fourth quarter.\n\nTherefore, no scores in the third quarter. So, going into the third quarter, it was 28-0 Patriots.\n\nWait, but the Patriots scored right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, so going into the third quarter, it was still 28-0.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to confirm if any of these events happened in the third quarter.\n\nLet's recap:\n\n- First half: Patriots 28, Jaguars 0.\n\n- Third quarter: Jaguars drive ends with interception, no score.\n\n- Patriots drive ends with a touchdown, but that was in the fourth quarter.\n\nTherefore, going into the third quarter, it was 28-0 Patriots.\n\nBut wait,\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The first regular season game for head coach Raheem Morris saw the Buccaneers fall to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 34-21. Running back Cadillac Williams returned as a starter, and rushed for 97 yards and one touchdown. Quarterback Byron Leftwich threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. The Buccaneer defense, however, gave up three big plays in the loss. Dallas quarterback Tony Romo threw for a career-best 353 yards. Three long touchdown passes (66, 80, 44 yards respectively) put the game out of reach. Early in the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay closed the deficit to 20-14, but Romo's 80-yard catch & run to Patrick Crayton put the Cowboys ahead for good. On specials teams, kicker Mike Nugent had one field goal attempt blocked, and shanked another.how many yards did Leftwich throw? \\\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about a football game between the Buccaneers and the Dallas Cowboys. It's talking about stats and what happened in the game. The question is: \"How many yards did Leftwich throw?\" Okay, so first, I need to find out who Leftwich is and what he did in the game.\n\nFrom the text, it says: \"Quarterback Byron Leftwich threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions.\" So, Byron Leftwich is the quarterback for the Buccaneers, and he threw for 276 yards. The question is asking for how many yards he threw, which in this context means how many passing yards he had.\n\nSo, it's pretty straightforward. He threw for 276 yards. But just to make sure, I should check if there's any other information in the text that might affect this answer.\n\nLet me read the text again: \"The first regular season game for head coach Raheem Morris saw the Buccaneers fall to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 34-21. Running back Cadillac Williams returned as a starter, and rushed for 97 yards and one touchdown. Quarterback Byron Leftwich threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions.

On specials teams, kicker Mike Nugent had one field goal attempt blocked, and shanked another.\"\n\nSo, the only mention of Leftwich is that he threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. There's no other information about his passing yards in the text. Therefore, the answer should be 276 yards.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that \"threw for 276 yards\" means passing yards. In football, when it says a quarterback threw for a certain number of yards, it typically refers to passing yards. So, 276 yards is his passing yardage for the game.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other quarterback mentioned for the Buccaneers. The text mentions Dallas quarterback Tony Romo, who threw for 353 yards, but it doesn't mention any other quarterbacks for Tampa Bay. So, Leftwich is likely the starting quarterback for the Buccaneers in this game.\n\nAlso, it's a game between the Buccaneers and the Cowboys, and the score was 34-21 in favor of the Cowboys. The Buccaneers had Cadillac Williams rushing for 97 yards and one touchdown, and Leftwich with 276 passing yards and one touchdown, no interceptions.\n\nThe defense gave up three big plays, which were long touchdown passes of 66, 80, and 44 yards. So, the Cowboys had a strong passing game, while the Buccaneers had a mix of running and passing.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Buccaneers closed the deficit to 20-14, but then Romo threw another long touchdown pass of 80 yards, which sealed the game for the Cowboys.\n\nOn special teams, kicker Mike Nugent had some issues, with one field goal blocked and another shanked, meaning he missed it or didn't kick it well.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Steelers stayed home for a SNF duel against longtime division rival Bengals.  The first quarter was all Steelers as they scored touchdowns in 3 different ways:  Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard, Antonio Brown caught a 12-yard pass, and then returned a punt 67 yards putting up scores of 7-0, 14-0, and 21-0.  This remains the most points in their franchise history they have scored in the first quarter while it remains the largest number of points the Bengals have allowed in the first quarter alone.  This streak of points stood at 24 straight as Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.  The Bengals finally got on the board as Gio Benard ran for a 1-yard touchdown making the score 24-7.  Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal to move his team ahead 27-7 at halftime.  After this, the Steelers went back to work in the 3rd quarter coming away with another field goal from 26 yards out for a 30-7 lead.  The 4th quarter however, was all Bengals as Andy Dalton and Tyler Eifert connected on a 1-yard touchdown pass making the score 30-14 not long before Dalton found Marvin Jones on a 13-yard pass making the score 30-20, but the 2-point conversion failed as the Steelers would eventually win the game with that score as the final sending them to 6-8.  Coupled with losses of the Ravens, Chargers, and Dolphins, the Steelers also remained in the playoff hunt.How many yards was the longest field goal?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about a football game between the Steelers and the Bengals. It's pretty detailed, but I need to find out what the longest field goal was in that game. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the field goals mentioned in the text and note their distances. Then, I can compare them to find out which one was the longest.\n\nLooking at the text, I see that Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal. Later, he nailed a 45-yard field goal, and then another one from 26 yards out in the 3rd quarter.\n\nSo, the field goals were:\n\n1. 25 yards\n\n2. 45 yards\n\n3. 26 yards\n\nNow, comparing these distances, 45 yards is the longest among them.\n\nBut, I should double-check if there were any other field goals mentioned that I might have missed. Let's read the text again carefully.\n\n\"Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal... Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal... Suisham then nailed a 26-yard field goal...\"\n\nThat's all the field goals mentioned. No others.\n\nSo, the longest field goal was 45 yards.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that there weren't any other players who kicked field goals. The text mentions Suisham as the kicker, and no other kickers are mentioned.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that there were no missed field goals that might have been longer, but since the question is about the longest field goal made, I don't need to consider missed attempts.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that the 45-yard field goal is indeed the longest, compared to the other two made field goals: 25 and 26 yards.\n\n45 is greater than 25 and 26, so it's the longest.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's some context in the text that could suggest another field goal that I haven't considered.\n\nLet's look again:\n\n\"The first quarter was all Steelers as they scored touchdowns in 3 different ways: Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard, Antonio Brown caught a 12-yard pass, and then returned a punt 67 yards putting up scores of 7-0, 14-0, and 21-0. This remains the most points in their franchise history they have scored in the first quarter while it remains the largest number of points the Bengals have allowed in the first quarter alone. This streak of points stood at 24 straight as Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo, after the three touchdowns, Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.\n\nThen, \"The Bengals finally got on the board as Gio Benard ran for a 1-yard touchdown making the score 24-7.\"\n\nWait, the score was 24-7 at that point, but earlier it was 21-0 after the three touchdowns, and then Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal to make it 24-0, and then the Bengals scored to make it 24-7.\n\nThen, \"Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal to move his team ahead 27-7 at halftime.\"\n\nAnd in the 3rd quarter, \"another field goal from 26 yards out for a 30-7 lead.\"\n\nSo, the field goals were:\n\n1. 25 yards, making it 24-0\n\n2. 45 yards, making it 27-7\n\n3. 26 yards, making it 30-7\n\nNo other field goals are mentioned.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years. Including the loss to the Redskins on Monday Night, the Cowboys have played in a total of 75 Monday Night games and have an overall record of 43-32.

Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs.

            "question": "Given the question statement:As of the 2010 census, the population of Tallahassee was estimated to be 181,376. There were 74,815 households, 21.3% of which had children under 18 living in them. 27.7% were married couples living together, 14.4% had a female householder with no husband, and 53.7% were non-families. 34.1% of all households were made up of individuals living alone and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.88. Children under the age of 5 were 5.5% of the population, persons under 18 were 17.2%, and persons 65 years or older were 8.1%. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males. 57.4% of the population was White, 35.0% Black, 3.7% Asian, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.3% some other race, and 2.3% two or more races. 6.3% were Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 53.3% were non-Hispanic White. For the period 2009\u20132013, the estimated median household income was $39,524, and the per capita income was $23,778. The number of persons below the poverty level was estimated at 30.2%.Were there more males or females in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here from the 2010 census about Tallahassee's population. It gives a bunch of statistics, and the question is: were there more males or females in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census?\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant information in this text. It looks like there's a section that says, \"For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males.\" Hmm, that seems promising.\n\nSo, if for every 100 females, there are 89.5 males, that means there are fewer males than females. Right? Because 89.5 is less than 100.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm understanding this ratio correctly. When it says \"for every 100 females, there were 89.5 males,\" it means that the number of males is 89.5% of the number of females.\n\nSo, if there are 100 females, there are 89.5 males. That clearly shows there are more females than males.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check another part of the text. It also says, \"For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males.\" Again, this suggests that there are fewer males than females in the 18 and over category.\n\nAdditionally, the text provides the percentage distribution by age and race, but that doesn't directly answer the question about males versus females overall.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems there are more females than males in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should calculate the actual numbers to confirm.\n\nThe total population was estimated to be 181,376.\n\nIf I can find the percentage of males and females, I can calculate the actual numbers.\n\nLooking back at the text, it says, \"For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males.\" But it doesn't directly give the percentages of males and females in the total population.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the ratio to find the actual numbers.\n\nLet me denote the number of females as F and the number of males as M.\n\nAccording to the ratio, M / F = 89.5 / 100 = 0.895.\n\nSo, M = 0.895 * F.\n\nAlso, the total population is M + F = 181,376.\n\nSubstituting M from above:\n\n0.895 * F + F = 181,376\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n1.895 * F = 181,376\n\nNow, solving for F:\n\nF = 181,376 / 1.895 \u2248 95,684.59 (but since population can't be a fraction, it must be rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, approximately 95,685 females.\n\nNow, M = 0.895 * 95,685 \u2248 85,691.08, which rounds to 85,691 males.\n\nSo, females: 95,685\n\nMales: 85,691\n\nIndeed, there are more females than males.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the percentages.\n\nPercentage of females:\n\n(95,685 / 181,376) * 100 \u2248 52.74%\n\nPercentage of males:\n\n(85,691 / 181,376) * 100 \u2248 47.26%\n\nSo, females make up about 52.74% of the population, and males make up about 47.26%.\n\nThis confirms that there are more females than males in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's check if there's any other information in the text that might contradict this conclusion.\n\nThe text also mentions that 57.4% of the population was White, 35.0% Black, 3.7% Asian, etc., but that's about race, not gender.\n\nIt also mentions that 6.3% were Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 53.3% were non-Hispanic White, but again, that's not directly related to gender.\n\nThe poverty levels and income statistics also don't affect the gender ratio.\n\nSo, I don't think there's any conflicting information here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After their win over the Eagles, the Giants stayed at home for a Monday night matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were coming back from London after their tie against the Redskins. Tom Coughlin, Justin Tuck, and Ernie Accorsi were inducted into the Giants Ring of Honor at halftime nursing a 14-10 lead. The Bengals quickly got 10 points and had a 6 point lead going into the 4th quarter. Sterling Shepard caught a touchdown on 4th and Goal to give the Giants a 21-20 lead. Their defense led by their vaunted pass rush took over and the offense successfully ran out the clock. The Giants improved to 6-3, their best start since the 2012 season.How many points was the lead going into halftime?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about a football game between the Giants and the Bengals. It says that the Giants were nursing a 14-10 lead at halftime. Then, in the second half, the Bengals came back and scored 10 points, giving them a 6-point lead going into the fourth quarter. After that, the Giants scored again to take a 21-20 lead, and then their defense held on to secure the win.\n\nThe question is: How many points was the lead going into halftime?\n\nWell, from the text, it directly states that the Giants had a 14-10 lead at halftime. So, the Giants had 14 points, and the Bengals had 10 points. That means the Giants were leading by 4 points going into halftime.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The text says, \"nursing a 14-10 lead at halftime.\" So, yes, that's clear. Giants had 14, Bengals had 10.\n\nThen, in the second half, the Bengals scored 10 points, which would bring their total to 20 points. If the Giants had 14 and the Bengals scored 10, that would make it Bengals 20, Giants 14, which is a 6-point lead for the Bengals going into the fourth quarter.\n\nBut wait, the text says the Bengals quickly got 10 points and had a 6-point lead going into the fourth quarter. So, if the Giants had 14 at halftime and the Bengals scored 10 points, making their total 20, that would indeed be a 6-point lead for the Bengals (20-14=6).\n\nThen, it says Sterling Shepard caught a touchdown on 4th and goal to give the Giants a 21-20 lead. So, the Giants scored another touchdown, which is typically 6 points, plus probably an extra point, making it 14+7=21.\n\nWait, but in football, a touchdown is 6 points, and then you can kick an extra point for 1 more point, making it 7 in total. Or, you can go for a two-point conversion, but that's less common.\n\nAssuming they went for the extra point, that would be 14 (at halftime) + 7 (touchdown plus extra point) = 21 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bengals had 20 points. So, Giants 21, Bengals 20.\n\nThen, the defense took over, and they ran out the clock to secure the win.\n\nThe final score was Giants 21, Bengals 20, and the Giants improved to 6-3, their best start since the 2012 season.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the lead going into halftime. As per the text, it was a 14-10 lead for the Giants, which is a 4-point lead.\n\nI don't see any ambiguity here. The answer should be 4 points.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's make sure there isn't any misinformation or misinterpretation.\n\n- At halftime: Giants 14, Bengals 10 \u2192 Giants lead by 4.\n\n- Bengals score 10 points in the second half: Bengals 20, Giants 14 \u2192 Bengals lead by 6.\n\n- Giants score a touchdown (6 points) and extra point (1 point), totaling 7 points: Giants 21, Bengals 20 \u2192 Giants lead by 1.\n\n- Then, the defense holds on to win.\n\nEverything adds up correctly.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising  in 1917 has been described as  the \"largest and most destructive\" anti-colonial rebellion in French Indochina between the Pacification of Tonkin in the 1880s and the Nghe-Tinh Revolt of 1930-31. On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region.  The rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards. The initial success of the rebels was short-lived.  They managed to control the prison and the town's administrative buildings for six days, but were all expelled on the seventh day by French government reinforcements. According to French reports 107 were killed on the colonial side and fifty-six on the anti-colonial, including Quyen. French forces were not able to pacify the surrounding countryside until six months later. Can reportedly committed suicide in January 1918 to avoid capture. Both Quyen and Can have since been accorded legendary status as nationalist heroes.How many rebels mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about the Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising in 1917. It seems like a significant event in the history of French Indochina, being described as the largest and most destructive anti-colonial rebellion between certain periods. The uprising involved a mutiny at the Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean Penitentiary, which was the largest in the region at that time.\n\nAccording to the text, the rebels were a mix of political prisoners, common criminals, and insubordinate prison guards. It mentions that they came from over thirty provinces, which suggests a broad base of dissatisfaction or opposition to the colonial rule.\n\nThe numbers provided are interesting: roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners, and 130 prison guards were involved at some point. So, if I add those up, 300 plus 200 is 500, and then plus 130 is 630. So, approximately 630 people were involved in the rebellion at some stage.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking for how many rebels mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary. Now, the mutiny started at the prison, so initially, it was probably the prisoners and some prison guards who turned against the authorities.\n\nLooking back at the numbers: 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards. The term \"ex-prisoners\" might be a bit confusing here. Did they mutiny while they were still prisoners, or did they escape and then become ex-prisoners?\n\nLet me read the text again carefully: \"an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary.\"\n\nSo, it was political prisoners, common criminals, and insubordinate prison guards who mutinied at the prison. The 300 civilians might have joined later or been part of the broader rebellion that spread beyond the prison.\n\nSo, focusing on the mutiny at the prison itself, it would be the political prisoners, common criminals, and insubordinate prison guards.\n\nThe text says roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners, and 130 prison guards were involved at some point. But the mutiny started at the prison, so likely the initial mutineers were the prisoners and the insubordinate guards.\n\nIf \"ex-prisoners\" refers to those who had escaped during the mutiny, then perhaps initially, it was the prisoners and guards who mutinied, and then they were joined by civilians later on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ex-prisoners\" refers to prisoners who had already been released but were involved in the rebellion. But that seems less likely given the context.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider that the mutiny began with prisoners and prison guards, and then they were joined by civilians from the surrounding area.\n\nBut the question is specifically about how many rebels mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary. So, probably, it's the prisoners and the prison guards who mutinied there.\n\nSo, if there were roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners, and 130 prison guards involved at some point, but the mutiny at the prison would primarily involve the prisoners and guards.\n\nWait, the text says \"the rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the 300 civilians are separate from the prisoners and guards.\n\nIf that's the case, then the mutiny at the prison would have been initiated by the prisoners and prison guards, totaling 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards, which is 330 people.\n\nBut then, the term \"ex-prisoners\" might be misleading. If they are ex-prisoners, did they mutiny while still imprisoned or after they escaped?\n\nI think \"ex-prisoners\" refers to prisoners who were involved in the rebellion, perhaps having escaped during the mutiny.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ex-prisoners\" refers to prisoners who were released or escaped and then participated in the rebellion.\n\nIn that case, the mutiny at the prison would have been started by current prisoners and insubordinate prison guards.\n\nBut to clarify, perhaps I should look up some more information about the Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising to get a better understanding of who the initial mutineers were.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that the Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising was indeed a significant event in Vietnamese history, involving a combination of political prisoners, common criminals, and prison guards who rebelled against French colonial rule.\n\nFrom various sources, it seems that the mutiny began when prisoners and some prison guards took control of the\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

It's an NFC South rivalry match, and the Panthers were trying to break a two-game losing streak. The game took place at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nLet me read through the text carefully to understand what happened in the game.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Panthers trailed early when QB Josh Freeman threw an 8-yard TD pass to WR Arrelious Benn. So, the Buccaneers scored first with that touchdown.\n\nThen, the Panthers narrowed the lead with kicker John Kasay making a 46-yard field goal.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The failure of the \u015eark\u00f6y-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianople's fate. On 11 March after a two weeks' bombardment which destroyed many of the fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General Nikola Ivanov, the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the modern Turkish General Staff History notes that 28,500 man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured . Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the fortress would have fallen eventually due to starvation. The most important result was that now the Ottoman command lost all hopes of regaining the initiative, which made any further fighting pointless.How many men does the Turkish General Staff History say survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about the \u015eark\u00f6y-Bulair operation and the siege of Adrianople during the First Balkan War. It's a bit dense, but I need to find out how many men the Turkish General Staff History says survived captivity, in addition to those who were unaccounted for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the numbers given. The text says that the Ottoman Empire started with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Then, it mentions that 60,000 men were captured, according to Richard Hall. But the Turkish General Staff History says that 28,500 men survived captivity, and there were 10,000 unaccounted for, possibly captured.\n\nWait, if 60,000 were captured according to Hall, but the Turkish history says 28,500 survived captivity and 10,000 unaccounted for, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I need to look at this differently.\n\nLet me see. The Ottoman Empire began with 61,250 men in the fortress. Then, it suffered 23,000 killed during the campaign. So, total Ottoman casualties are 23,000 killed.\n\nNow, the number of prisoners is less clear. Hall says 60,000 were captured, but the Turkish history says that of the original 61,250, 28,500 survived captivity and 10,000 are unaccounted for.\n\nHmm. So, if they started with 61,250, and 23,000 were killed, that would leave 61,250 - 23,000 = 38,250 men who were either captured or somehow not killed.\n\nBut according to the Turkish history, 28,500 survived captivity and 10,000 are unaccounted for. So, 28,500 + 10,000 = 38,500, which is close to the 38,250 that should be left after subtracting the killed.\n\nMaybe the discrepancy is due to rounding or different sources.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the number of men who survived captivity in addition to those who were unaccounted for, according to the Turkish General Staff History.\n\nAccording to the Turkish history, 28,500 survived captivity and 10,000 are unaccounted for. So, in total, that's 28,500 + 10,000 = 38,500 men.\n\nBut to answer the question specifically: the number of men who survived captivity in addition to those who were unaccounted for is 28,500 + 10,000 = 38,500.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the sum of those who survived captivity and those who were unaccounted for. If that's the case, then it's indeed 28,500 + 10,000 = 38,500.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the number who survived captivity plus the unaccounted for, perhaps considering the unaccounted for as possibly dead or captured, but since the text says \"in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for,\" it seems like it's just a sum.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 38,500.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStarting number: 61,250\n\nKilled: 23,000\n\nCaptured: presumably the rest, which is 61,250 - 23,000 = 38,250\n\nAccording to Turkish history: of the captured, 28,500 survived captivity, and 10,000 are unaccounted for.\n\nSo, the total captured is 28,500 (survived) + 10,000 (unaccounted for) = 38,500, which is slightly more than the 38,250 derived from subtracting killed from total, but perhaps this is due to rounding or different accounting methods.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

Systematically blocking passage between Gangwha and the mainland, they brought nearby islands and coastal regions under their domain. Wang On, a royal kinsman was proclaimed king of the maritime kingdom. They gave up Ganghwa Island and fled to Jindo Island in the southwest. Although the Sambyeolcho raided the coastlines of Jeolla Province, the southwestern province, Jin Island started to face food shortages in January 1271. In February the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender. In response, its leader, Bae Jungson, asked Kublai Khan to secure Jeolla Province and put it under the direct rule of the empire, just as preceding rebels had. But his request was never fulfilled. In April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels. It only took a month until Jin Island fell to a combined Goryeo and Mongol army. The puppet king was killed and the survivors, led by Kim Tongjeong , fled to Jeju Island. The rebels captured the island and banished the king of Tamna in November 1270. The Sambyeolcho laid low until the end of 1271. During that time, they sought help from Japanese Kamakura Shogunate. They regained their strength to some degree the following year. They repeatedly looted the Korean coast. A combined Goryeo-Mongol assault began in February 1272, and crushed the rebels in April. Thereafter, the Mongols directly controlled Tamna until 1294.How many months was it in between the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender and the Yuan court deciding to crush the rebels?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text about the Sambyeolcho rebellion during the time of the Mongol invasions of Korea. It's a bit complicated with a lot of dates and events, but I need to find out how many months passed between the Yuan dynasty calling for the Sambyeolcho's surrender and the Yuan court deciding to crush the rebels.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant dates in the text. The text says that in February, the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender. Then, in April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels.\n\nSo, the call for surrender was in February, and the decision to crush the rebels was in April. I need to calculate the number of months between these two events.\n\nFrom February to April is two months. February to March is one month, and March to April is another month, so that's a total of two months.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The text mentions several other dates, like January 1271, November 1270, and so on, but for this specific question, I only need to consider the dates in February and April.\n\nYes, it's straightforward. February to April is two months.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After their bye week, the Lions traveled to Chicago, Illinois for a rematch with their division foes the Chicago Bears. Chicago started the scoring with a 6-yard touchdown rush by Matt Forte. The Bears added to their lead with a 43-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. In the second quarter, Chicago added more points with a 35-yard field goal, and made it a 20-0 game when Devin Hester returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Detroit finally got on the board with two consecutive field goals by Jason Hanson, from 29 and 35 yards out respectively. After halftime, the Bears defense intercepted Lions QB Matthew Stafford twice for touchdowns. First, Major Wright caught one and ran it in 24 yards. Then Charles Tillman completed a 44-yard pick 6. The Bears added to their large lead with a 50-yard field goal. The Lions scored their only points of the second half with a 10-yard touchdown catch by Tony Scheffler. This was the Lions' first road loss of the season. The game was marred by an on-field fight between players midway through the 4th quarter.How many field goals did Hanson kick in the second quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears. It's a bit detailed, but I'll try to break it down step by step to find out how many field goals Jason Hanson kicked in the second quarter.\n\nFirst, let's understand the context. The Lions are playing against the Bears after their bye week, which means they had a rest and are coming back to play. The Bears scored first with a 6-yard touchdown run by Matt Forte. Then, Robbie Gould, the Bears' kicker, made a 43-yard field goal. So, at this point, it's all Bears scoring in the first quarter.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter, the Bears added another field goal, this time from 35 yards out. So, that's a second field goal by Gould. Then, Devin Hester, the Bears' return man, had an 82-yard punt return for a touchdown, making it 20-0 for the Bears.\n\nNow, the Lions finally get on the board with two consecutive field goals by Jason Hanson. The first one is from 29 yards out, and the second is from 35 yards out. So, in the second quarter, Hanson kicked two field goals.\n\nAfter halftime, the game continued with more scoring, but since the question is only about the second quarter, I don't need to worry about what happened in the second half.\n\nTo confirm, let's list out all the scoring plays mentioned:\n\n1. Bears: 6-yard TD run by Matt Forte.\n\n2. Bears: 43-yard FG by Robbie Gould (1st quarter).\n\n3. Bears: 35-yard FG by Robbie Gould (2nd quarter).\n\n4. Bears: 82-yard punt return TD by Devin Hester.\n\n5. Lions: 29-yard FG by Jason Hanson (2nd quarter).\n\n6. Lions: 35-yard FG by Jason Hanson (2nd quarter).\n\nThen, in the second half, there were more scores, but again, I'm only focusing on the second quarter.\n\nSo, in the second quarter, Hanson kicked two field goals: one from 29 yards and another from 35 yards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is two field goals.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there aren't any other field goals by Hanson in the second quarter that aren't mentioned. The text says, \"Detroit finally got on the board with two consecutive field goals by Jason Hanson, from 29 and 35 yards out respectively.\" There's no mention of any other field goals by Hanson in the second quarter.\n\nAlso, to double-check, the Bears kicked a 50-yard field goal, but that was in the second half, after halftime. So, that doesn't count in the second quarter.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

His father was General Charles John Lawrence and is said to have served in Flanders under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Charles Lawrence's earlier life is obscure. He was commissioned in the 11th Regiment of Foot and served in the West Indies from 1733 until 1737. He then served in the War Office. He was made lieutenant in 1731 and then captain in 1745. He was wounded while serving with the 54th Foot in the battle of Fontenoy in 1745.What position did Charles Lawrence achieve the same year he was wounded?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about Charles Lawrence's military career. It says he followed his father into a military career, and his father was General Charles John Lawrence, who served under the famous John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, in Flanders. That's interesting, but I think the main focus is on Charles Lawrence himself.\n\nLet me see. The text mentions that Charles Lawrence's earlier life is a bit obscure, which might make things tricky, but let's see what information is provided.\n\nIt says he was commissioned in the 11th Regiment of Foot and served in the West Indies from 1733 until 1737. After that, he worked in the War Office. His ranks: he was made lieutenant in 1731 and then captain in 1745. Importantly, he was wounded while serving with the 54th Foot in the battle of Fontenoy in 1745.\n\nThe question is asking what position he achieved in the same year he was wounded, which was 1745.\n\nSo, looking at the dates:\n\n- Commissioned in the 11th Regiment in an unspecified year.\n\n- Lieutenant in 1731.\n\n- Served in the West Indies from 1733 to 1737.\n\n- Worked in the War Office, but no specific dates given for that period.\n\n- Captain in 1745.\n\n- Wounded in battle in 1745.\n\nGiven that, it seems like he became a captain in 1745, and was wounded in the same year. So, the position he achieved in the year he was wounded is captain.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't any other information that suggests he achieved another position in that year.

In the first quarter, Oakland got the early lead with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 23-yard and a 35-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Bills responded with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 14-yard TD run. The Raiders would end the half with Janikowski kicking a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders increased its lead with QB JaMarcus Russell getting a 1-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Buffalo started to rally as Lynch got a 3-yard TD run. Oakland would respond as Russell completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR Johnnie Lee Higgins, yet the Bills got near as QB Trent Edwards completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Roscoe Parrish. Later, Buffalo completed its rally as kicker Rian Lindell nailed the game-winning 38-yard field goal. After the game, Chris Mortensen of ESPN and Jay Glazer of Fox Sports both erroneously reported that Lane Kiffin would be fired the following Monday; this turned out not to be the case, as Kiffin was coaching the team during Week 4.How many more TD runs did Lynch get than Russell?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this problem to solve based on a football game between the Raiders and the Bills.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to rebound from their Week 3 road loss to the Raiders, the Jets flew to M&T Bank Stadium for a Week 4 Sunday night battle with the Baltimore Ravens.  New York trailed early in the first quarter with Ravens linebacker Jameel McClain returning a fumble 6 yards for a touchdown. The Jets would respond with running back Joe McKnight returning a kickoff 107 yards for a touchdown. Baltimore would regain the lead with kicker Billy Cundiff getting a 38-yard field goal, followed by running back Ray Rice getting a 3-yard touchdown run. The Ravens added onto their lead in the second quarter with Cundiff making another 38-yard field goal, followed by linebacker Jarret Johnson returning a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown. New York responded with linebacker David Harris returning an interception 36 yards for a touchdown, followed by a 40-yard field goal from kicker Nick Folk. Baltimore came right back in the third quarter with cornerback Lardarius Webb returning an interception 73 yards for a touchdown. From there, the Ravens' defense prevented any comeback attempt.How many total yards were made by field goal in the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Jets and the Ravens. There's a bunch of scoring plays mentioned, and I need to find out how many total yards were made by field goals in the game. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the field goals mentioned in the text. The text talks about a few different types of scores: touchdowns from fumbles, kickoff returns, and regular touchdown runs, as well as field goals. So, I should focus on the field goals.\n\nLooking at the text, I see that the Ravens' kicker, Billy Cundiff, made a 38-yard field goal and another 38-yard field goal in the second quarter. That's two field goals, each for 38 yards. Then, the Jets' kicker, Nick Folk, made a 40-yard field goal. So, that's another field goal for 40 yards.\n\nNow, to find the total yards from field goals, I need to add up the yardages of all these field goals. So, that's 38 yards plus 38 yards plus 40 yards.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n38 + 38 = 76 yards\n\nThen, 76 + 40 = 116 yards\n\nSo, the total yards from field goals in the game is 116 yards.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that I didn't miss any other field goals mentioned in the text. Let's read through the text again.\n\n\"the Ravens, the Jets flew to M&T Bank Stadium for a Week 4 Sunday night battle with the Baltimore Ravens.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1783, the Cataraqui region was selected by the British as a location to settle United Empire Loyalists who had fled the United States after the American War of Independence. The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks.  During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops. Many of the present barrack buildings were built between 1821 and 1824.How many more men than officers worked on the building of the fort?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this history text here about the Cataraqui region and the building of a fort that eventually became T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks in Kingston. It mentions that in October 1783, a bunch of buildings were completed there, and then later during the War of 1812, it was a busy military place. But the actual question is: how many more men than officers worked on building the fort?\n\nOkay, let's dig into the text to find the numbers I need. It says that Major John Ross, who was in charge at Oswego, was told by Governor Haldimand to fix up and rebuild the fort to hold a military garrison. And it was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. So, there were 422 men and 25 officers working on it.\n\nThe question is asking for how many more men there were than officers. So, I need to find the difference between the number of men and the number of officers.\n\nLet me just write that down:\n\nNumber of men: 422\n\nNumber of officers: 25\n\nDifference: 422 - 25\n\nLet me do that subtraction:\n\n422 minus 25 is 397.\n\nSo, there were 397 more men than officers working on the fort.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other information in the text that might relate to this? Let's scan back to make sure.\n\nIt mentions that by October 1783, they had completed a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse. But it's the same group of 422 men and 25 officers who did all that.\n\nAlso, it says that in 1787, the fort was renamed T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks, and during the War of 1812, it was a focus of military activity, housing many military troops. But for the question at hand, those details aren't necessary. We've already got the numbers we need.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's make sure there aren't any other numbers or mentions of personnel in the text. The next relevant date is 1821 to 1824, when more barrack buildings were built, but that's after the period we're concerned with here.\n\nSo, to confirm, the difference between the number of men and officers is indeed 422 minus 25, which is 397.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:On 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian forces would begin to pull out of Georgia the following day. The two countries exchanged prisoners of war on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians, among them two civilians, Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians. On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori. Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed; however, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two Russian lookout stations remained near Poti. On 13 September, Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned. Withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi also took place. Russian forces withdrew from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and authority over them was transferred to the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia. Russia continued to maintain a single checkpoint in the border village of Perevi. On 12 December, Russian forces withdrew; eight hours later they re-entered the village and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire. Russian forces then set up three checkpoints in the village. On 18 October 2010 all Russian troops in Perevi withdrew to South Ossetia and a Georgian Army unit moved in. On 9 September 2008, Russia announced that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was essential to prevent Georgia from regaining control. Georgia considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russian-occupied territories. In November 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied Georgian territories.Did Russian troops withdraw from western Georgia first or the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about Russian troops withdrawing from different parts of Georgia after some conflict. The question is asking whether Russian troops withdrew from western Georgia first or from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nLet me read the text carefully to find the dates when these withdrawals happened.\n\nFirst, it says that on 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and Georgian police moved towards Gori. Then, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two lookout stations near Poti. So, seems like some withdrawal was happening on 22 August.\n\nThen, on 13 September, Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia, and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned. Also, withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi took place.\n\nAfter that, on 8 October, Russian forces withdrew from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and authority over them was transferred to the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia.\n\nSo, let's note down the dates:\n\n- Withdrawal from Igoeti and movement towards Gori: 22 August\n\n- Withdrawal from western Georgia (including posts near Poti, Senaki, Khobi): 13 September\n\n- Withdrawal from buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia: 8 October\n\nSo, comparing the dates:\n\n- Withdrawal from western Georgia: 13 September\n\n- Withdrawal from buffer zones: 8 October\n\nThat means withdrawal from western Georgia happened first, on 13 September, and then from the buffer zones on 8 October.\n\nSo, the answer should be that Russian troops withdrew from western Georgia first, before withdrawing from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other information in the text that might contradict this or provide more context.\n\nIt mentions that on 12 December, Russian forces withdrew from Perevi, but then re-entered the village and set up three checkpoints. Then, on 18 October 2010, all Russian troops in Perevi withdrew to South Ossetia, and Georgian Army unit moved in.\n\nBut Perevi seems to be a specific location; perhaps it's part of the buffer zone or a separate area. Since it's mentioned separately, I think the main withdrawals were the ones on 13 September and 8 October.\n\nAlso, on 9 September 2008, Russia announced that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. So, that might indicate that some troops stayed in those regions, but in terms of the buffer zones, they withdrew on 8 October.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Regent Moray and his secretary John Wood tried to gain English support by producing the Casket letters in England, which were intended to incriminate Mary in the death of Lord Darnley. Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \"Captain General.\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war.Which two Queens are mentioned?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Let's see.

            "question": "Given the question statement:James Douglas was the second son of Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, Master of Angus, and Elizabeth Douglas, daughter David Douglas of Pittendreich. He wrote that he was over 61 years old in March 1578, so was probably born around 1516. Before 1543 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Morton. In 1553 James Douglas succeeded to the title and estates of his father-in-law, including Dalkeith House in Midlothian, and Aberdour Castle in Fife. Elizabeth Douglas and her two elder sisters, who were married to Regent Arran and Lord Maxwell, suffered from mental ill-health. Their children either did not survive to adulthood, or in the case of three daughters were declared legally incompetent in 1581. James also had five illegitimate children At the start of war of the Rough Wooing, James and his brother David communicated with Henry VIII of England on the possibility of their surrendering Tantallon Castle to the English army that burnt Edinburgh in 1544. However, four years later he defended Dalkeith Palace against the English and was captured in June 1548, \"sore hurt on the thigh \" and taken as a hostage to England. After the Treaty of Boulogne brought peace, in 1550 James returned from captivity in England and was exchanged for the English soldier John Luttrell, and began to use his title of \"Earl of Morton.\" In 1559 James's political activities and allegiances during the Scottish Reformation were at first equivocal, but in February 1560 he signed the Treaty of Berwick which invited an English army into Scotland to expel the Catholic regime of Mary of Guise. He took part in the unsuccessful embassy to England in November 1560 to treat for the marriage of Elizabeth I of England to James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran.Who was born first: Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich or James Douglas?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text about James Douglas and his family, and I need to figure out who was born first between Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich and James Douglas. Let's see what the text says.\n\nFirst, it mentions that James Douglas was the second son of Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich and Elizabeth Douglas. So, James is the son of Sir George. That means Sir George is the father.\n\nThen, it says that James was probably born around 1516. And it mentions that Sir George was the Master of Angus, and Elizabeth was the daughter of David Douglas of Pittendreich.\n\nSo, Sir George must be older than James since he's the father. But I need to confirm if there's any information about Sir George's birth date.\n\nLooking back at the text, it doesn't directly state Sir George's birth year. However, since James was born around 1516, and he was the second son, his father, Sir George, would have to be older, probably by quite a few years, considering that he had to be of marrying age when James was born.\n\nIn those times, men often married in their twenties or even thirties, so if Sir George was, say, 25 when James was born in 1516, that would make him born around 1491. But this is just an estimation.\n\nBut the question is who was born first, Sir George or James. Well, since Sir George is the father, he has to be born before James.\n\nSo, the answer is Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich was born before James Douglas.\n\nBut to make sure, let's see if there's any other information in the text that might contradict this.\n\nThe text mentions that Elizabeth Douglas, James's mother, was the daughter of David Douglas of Pittendreich. So, she would also be younger than Sir George, as she's his wife.\n\nThere's no other information about the birth dates of Sir George or Elizabeth, so based on the father-son relationship, it's clear that Sir George was born before James.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:A total of about 790,000 tickets were put on sale from February 2015 online, at the Singapore Indoor Stadium and at SingPost outlets. To encourage public participation in the games, it was announced on 28 January 2015 that 18 of the sports will be free for spectators, while the other 18 are kept at relatively affordable levels of between S$5 to S$20. By 15 April 2015 some sports such as swimming and fencing were selling fast, while silat and sepak takraw were much less popular. Organisers reported that ticket sales were pass 70% for most sports by 27 April, with fencing and swimming being the most popular at 85 and 70% tickets sold respectively, while rhythmic gymnastics, silat and wushu have also sold over 70%. Billiards and snooker, equestrian, sepak takraw, taekwondo, and artistic gymnastics have sold about half their tickets. Rugby and judo have sold 30%, while table tennis has sold only 20%. Priced between S$5 to S$20, priority sales for the opening and closing ceremonies tickets for those who registered theirs interests in 2014 began on 15 January 2015, while sales for the general public began on 22 January 2015. In February 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were going at over seven times their original value on unauthorised websites, despite 40% of the tickets still available at that time. By March 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were sold out.For how many months were opening ceremony tickets available to the general public before being sold out?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have information about ticket sales for the opening ceremony of some event, probably the Southeast Asian Games since it mentions Singapore Indoor Stadium and sports like sepak takraw and silat. But the main focus is to find out for how many months the opening ceremony tickets were available to the general public before they sold out.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key dates mentioned in the text regarding ticket sales for the opening ceremony.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n- \"priority sales for the opening and closing ceremonies tickets for those who registered theirs interests in 2014 began on 15 January 2015\"\n\n- \"sales for the general public began on 22 January 2015\"\n\n- \"In February 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were going at over seven times their original value on unauthorised websites, despite 40% of the tickets still available at that time.\"\n\n- \"By March 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were sold out.\"\n\nSo, priority sales started on January 15, 2015, and general public sales started on January 22, 2015. Tickets were still available in February 2015, and by March 2015, they were sold out.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of months the tickets were available to the general public before selling out.\n\nLet's consider the general public sales started on January 22, 2015, and tickets sold out by March 2015.\n\nSo, from January 22 to March 2015.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of months between these dates.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Sales started on the 22nd, so the number of days in January that tickets were available is 31 - 22 + 1 = 10 days in January.\n\nFebruary 2015 had 28 days (since 2015 is not a leap year). So, 28 days in February.\n\nMarch 2015, tickets sold out sometime in March. The exact date is not specified, but since it says \"by March 2015,\" it means by the end of March.\n\nSo, total days tickets were available to the general public:\n\n10 days in January + 28 days in February + some days in March.\n\nBut the question is in months. How to convert this into months?\n\nOne approach is to consider that from January 22 to March 31 is approximately 2 months and 9 days (since January has 31 days, from Jan 22 to Jan 31 is 10 days, plus February 28 days, plus March 31 days, totaling 69 days. 69 days is roughly 2.27 months.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to consider that from January 22 to March 31 is about 2.5 months.\n\nHowever, since the tickets sold out \"by March 2015,\" it could be any day in March. If we assume it sold out by the end of March, then it's about 2.5 months.\n\nBut maybe we can be more precise.\n\nLet's assume that the tickets sold out by the end of March. So, from January 22 to March 31 is how many months?\n\nFrom January 22 to February 22 is one month, and from February 22 to March 22 is another month, and then 9 days in March.\n\nSo, approximately 2 months and 9 days, which is roughly 2.3 months.\n\nBut since the question is about months, and probably expects a whole number, maybe it's 2 months.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that sales started on January 22 and sold out by March, that's across 3 months: January, February, and March.\n\nBut the general public sales started in January and sold out in March, so it was available for 2 full months (February and March), plus the partial month of January.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is 2 months.\n\nWait, but from January 22 to March 31 is roughly 2.5 months.\n\nMaybe the answer is 2 months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3 months, considering January, February, and March.\n\nBut since sales started on January 22, which is towards the end of January, and sold out by the end of March, it was available for purchase across three months, but with limited time in January.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

In April 2010, the U.S. unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the governments broader U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%. In April 2012, the unemployment rate was 4.6% in Japan. In a 2012 news story, the Financial Post reported, \"Nearly 75 million youth are unemployed around the world, an increase of more than 4 million since 2007. In the European Union, where a debt crisis followed the financial crisis, the youth unemployment rate rose to 18% last year from 12.5% in 2007, the ILO report shows.\" In March 2018, according to U.S. Unemployment Rate Statistics, the unemployment rate was 4,1%, so it is below to 4.5 to 5.0%, which is the norm, this means that there is still need of employees to work.In which year was the unemployment rate higher in the EU, 2012 or 2007?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about unemployment rates in the EU, comparing 2012 to 2007. The text provides some data points, and I need to figure out in which year the unemployment rate was higher in the EU.\n\nFirst, I need to find the unemployment rates for the EU in both 2007 and 2012. Looking at the text, I see that in April 2010, the U.S. unemployment rate was 9.9%, and the broader U-6 rate was 17.1%. But that's for the U.S., not the EU. Then, in April 2012, Japan's unemployment rate was 4.6%. That's not helpful for this comparison either.\n\nAh, here's a relevant part: \"In the European Union, where a debt crisis followed the financial crisis, the youth unemployment rate rose to 18% last year from 12.5% in 2007, the ILO report shows.\" So, this is talking about youth unemployment in the EU, with 18% in 2012 and 12.5% in 2007.\n\nBut the question is about overall unemployment, not just youth unemployment. Maybe the youth unemployment rates are higher, but I need to find the general unemployment rates for the EU in these years.\n\nWait, perhaps the youth unemployment rates are indicative of the overall rates. If youth unemployment increased from 12.5% in 2007 to 18% in 2012, that suggests that the overall unemployment might have also increased during that period. But I don't have the actual overall unemployment rates here.\n\nLet me see if there's any other information in the text that could help. The first sentence mentions that about 25 million people in the world's thirty richest countries will have lost their jobs between the end of 2007 and the end of 2010 due to the economic downturn. That suggests that unemployment was rising during that period.\n\nAlso, the Financial Post reported nearly 75 million youth were unemployed around the world, an increase of more than 4 million since 2007. Again, this is about youth unemployment globally, not specifically the EU.\n\nIn March 2018, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1%, which is below the norm of 4.5 to 5.0%, indicating a tighter job market.\n\nBut none of these directly give me the overall unemployment rates for the EU in 2007 and 2012.\n\nMaybe I need to make an inference based on the information provided. Since the youth unemployment rate in the EU increased from 12.5% in 2007 to 18% in 2012, and considering that youth unemployment rates are often higher than the general unemployment rates, it's likely that the overall unemployment rate also increased during that period.\n\nBut to directly answer the question: in which year was the unemployment rate higher in the EU, 2012 or 2007? Based on the increase in youth unemployment and the general economic downturn mentioned, it's reasonable to conclude that the unemployment rate was higher in 2012 than in 2007.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Steelers traveled to London, England and were considered the visitor team against a Matt Cassel-led Vikings team.  The Vikes got off to a fast start as Blair Walsh nailed a 54-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead followed up by Matt Cassel hooking up with Greg Jennings on a 70-yard touchdown pass for a 10-0 lead.  The Steelers managed to get on the board later on in the first quarter when rookie RB Le'Von Bell ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the game 10-7.  The Vikes moved ahead by double digits in the second quarter as Adrian Peterson ran for a 60-yard touchdown for a 17-7 lead.  Shaun Suisham got the Steelers within a touchdown by nailing a 26-yard field goal for a 17-10 lead.  Walsh moved the Vikes ahead by 10 at halftime by kicking a 37-yard field goal for a 20-10 lead.  The Steelers came within 3 as Le'Von Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown shortening the lead to 20-17 but the Vikes managed to move ahead 27-17 after Peterson ran for a 7-yard touchdown and then Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make the lead 34-17.  In the 4th quarter, Jerricho Cotchery hooked up with Ben Roethlisberger on a 15-yard touchdown pass for a 34-24 lead, and then tried to rally as Suisham nailed a 28-yard field goal.  The Steelers' comeback attempt was ruined again as Roethlisberger was sacked and fumbled the ball with less than a minute left in the game sealing the victory for the Vikes. With this loss, the Steelers are off to their worst start since the AFL-NFL merger. They had last started 0-4 in 1968, when they started 0-6.  This is also the first time since 2006 in which the team would fall to 4 games below .500 when they started that season 2-6.What country was this game between the Vikings and Steelers played in?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about a football game between the Steelers and the Vikings. It says they played in London, England, and the Steelers were considered the visitor team. The Vikings had Matt Cassel as their quarterback, and they scored first with a field goal and then a touchdown pass to Greg Jennings. The Steelers got on the board with a touchdown run by Le'Von Bell, and the game went back and forth with more scores from both teams.\n\nThe text mentions that the Steelers are off to their worst start since the AFL-NFL merger, last starting 0-4 in 1968, and it's the first time since 2006 they've been four games below .500 after starting 2-6. But the question is straightforward: in what country was this game played?\n\nWell, it clearly states that the game was played in London, England. So, England is part of the United Kingdom, but the country in question here is England. However, since the UK is a collection of countries including England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, sometimes \"England\" is used interchangeably with \"Britain\" or \"the UK,\" but strictly speaking, England is a country within the UK.\n\nBut for this question, since it's asking for the country and it's specified as London, England, I think the answer is England. Alternatively, if considering the broader political entity, it could be the United Kingdom. But given that the text specifies \"England,\" I'll go with England.\n\nWait a minute, the question is: \"What country was this game between the Vikings and Steelers played in?\" and the text says \"London, England.\" So, England is the country here. Although England is part of the United Kingdom, in this context, since it's specified as England, that's likely the answer they're looking for.\n\nI should probably confirm if London is in England because sometimes there's confusion with the different parts of the UK. Yes, London is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, so England is the correct answer.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Raiders made it to their fourth Super Bowl in team history after posting a 12-4 regular season record. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed 230 out of 379 (60.7 percent) passes resulting in 2,935 yards and 20 touchdowns.  His favorite target was tight end Todd Christensen, who led the NFL with 92 receptions for 1,247 yards and 12 touchdowns. Wide receivers Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell combined for 74 receptions, 1,209 yards, and 6 touchdowns. But the largest impact on offense was running back Marcus Allen. In just his second NFL season, Allen led the team in rushing yards (1,014) and total yards from scrimmage (1,604), while ranking second on the team in receptions (68) and touchdowns (11). But Allen was not the only key running back on the team. Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined for 1,119 total rushing and receiving yards, and 10 touchdowns.  Los Angeles also had a powerful special teams attack led by Greg Pruitt, who led the NFL in punt returns (58), and punt return yards (666), while adding another 604 yards returning kickoffs and rushing for 154 yards and two scores.Which players mentioned are running backs?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about the Raiders' performance in a season where they made it to the Super Bowl. It's talking about their regular season record and some stats about their players. The question is asking which players mentioned are running backs.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the players mentioned in the text and see who among them are running backs.\n\nLet's list out all the players mentioned:\n\n1. Jim Plunkett - He's the quarterback.\n\n2. Todd Christensen - He's a tight end.\n\n3. Cliff Branch - He's a wide receiver.\n\n4. Malcolm Barnwell - Also a wide receiver.\n\n5. Marcus Allen - He's a running back. The text says \"running back Marcus Allen.\"\n\n6. Kenny King - Described as \"running back.\"\n\n7. Frank Hawkins - Mentioned along with Kenny King, and they combined for certain stats, so he's likely a running back too.\n\n8. Greg Pruitt - He's on special teams, handling punt returns and kickoff returns, and also had some rushing yards.\n\nSo, from this list, Marcus Allen, Kenny King, and Frank Hawkins are identified as running backs. Greg Pruitt is mentioned as being on special teams and having some rushing yards, but he's primarily known for his return duties, not as a running back.\n\nWait, but the question is: Which players mentioned are running backs?\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Marcus Allen: Clearly stated as a running back.\n\n- Kenny King: Explicitly called a running back.\n\n- Frank Hawkins: Mentioned alongside Kenny King, and they combined for rushing and receiving yards, so it's likely he's a running back as well.\n\n- Greg Pruitt: He's described as having 154 yards rushing, but his primary role is in special teams as a return man.\n\nSo, the main running backs are Allen, King, and Hawkins.\n\nBut the question is: Which players mentioned are running backs?\n\nI need to make sure I'm including all players who are running backs.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n\"running back Marcus Allen.\"\n\n\"running back Kenny King\"\n\n\"Frank Hawkins\"\n\nSo, Frank Hawkins is grouped with Kenny King, and they combined for 1,119 total rushing and receiving yards, and 10 touchdowns.\n\nGiven that both are mentioned together and their combined stats include rushing yards, it's reasonable to conclude that Frank Hawkins is also a running back.\n\nGreg Pruitt, on the other hand, is described as having 154 rushing yards, but his primary role is in special teams.\n\nTherefore, the running backs mentioned are:\n\n- Marcus Allen\n\n- Kenny King\n\n- Frank Hawkins\n\nSo, the final answer should be these three players.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if there are any other players who might be running backs.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n\"wide receivers Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell\"\n\n\"tight end Todd Christensen\"\n\n\"quarterback Jim Plunkett\"\n\n\"Greg Pruitt, who led the NFL in punt returns\"\n\nNo other players are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, only Allen, King, and Hawkins are the running backs.\n\nWait, but in the question, it says \"Which players mentioned are running backs?\"\n\nIf the question is asking for all players who are running backs, and based on the text, only Allen, King, and Hawkins are identified as running backs.\n\nGreg Pruitt is not described as a running back, even though he had some rushing yards.\n\nSo, the answer should be Marcus Allen, Kenny King, and Frank Hawkins.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting just the names, without the surnames, or in a specific format.\n\nBut since the question is \"Which players mentioned are running backs?\", and it's likely expecting the full names, I'll go with that.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Facing a desperate season verging on the point of disaster yet again, the Browns traveled again in Week 10 to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta to meet the Atlanta Falcons. The 5-3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7-0 lead. The second quarter started with a bang for the Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback Michael Vick threw an interception to Browns safety Sean Jones. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26. However, Falcons kicker Morten Andersen kicked a 44-yard field goal to get on the board 14-3 at halftime Very little happened in the third quarter. Michael Vick was driving in Cleveland territory with 5:28 remaining when he was intercepted again by Browns safety Brodney Pool. However, the ensuing Browns possession resulted in a Dave Zastudil punt. The punt was out of their own endzone and was returned to the Browns 12. It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. The possibility of success seemed unlikely for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained favorable field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal.  At that point the Browns were leading 14-13. The next drive for the Browns looked promising. After two passes to tight end Steve Heiden and a 36-yard pass to Kellen Winslow, the Browns then faltered and had to settle for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal. The score was 17-13. With 3:18 remaining in the game, Atlanta took over on their own 28-yard line. Down by 4, Vick let in loose downfield to an open receiver Roddy White for a 55-yard gain. The Falcons then committed a 10-yard penalty and Vick threw an incomplete pass. With 2nd and 20 on the Cleveland 27, Vick fumbled the ball on 3rd down to a waiting Browns rookie cornerback Jereme Perry. Out of timeouts, the Falcons fell for a second week in a row to the Browns.How many points did Cleveland win by?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this football game to analyze between the Cleveland Browns and the Atlanta Falcons. It's Week 10, and the Browns are heading to the Georgia Dome, where the Falcons are playing. The Falcons are 5-3 and looking to bounce back from a loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 9. The Browns, on the other hand, seem to be in a rough spot, but let's see how this game plays out.\n\nFirst quarter: Not much happening until late in the quarter. With 3:33 left, Browns' quarterback Charlie Frye throws a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, placing the ball on the Falcons' 6-yard line. Three plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns score a touchdown with a run by Reuben Droughns. So, Browns lead 7-0.\n\nSecond quarter: Browns start strong. They score another touchdown quickly, with Charlie Frye connecting with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard pass with 11:59 left in the quarter. Now, it's 14-0 Browns. Later, near the two-minute warning, Droughns fumbles on the Falcons' 35. Falcons try a two-minute drill but can't advance, and kicker Morten Andersen kicks a 44-yard field goal, making it 14-3 at halftime.\n\nThird quarter: Not much happening until with 5:28 left, Michael Vick is intercepted by Browns' safety Brodney Pool. However, the Browns can't capitalize, and the Falcons get the ball back. They drive down the field and score a touchdown, making it 14-10.\n\nFourth quarter: Both teams have some struggles. After exchanges, Atlanta gets good field position and Andersen kicks a 46-yard field goal, making it 14-13 Browns. Browns then drive the ball, but stall and kick a 43-yard field goal by Phil Dawson, making it 17-13.\n\nWith 3:18 left, Atlanta gets the ball on their own 28. They have a big play, a 55-yard gain to Roddy White. But then there's a 10-yard penalty, and on 2nd and 20 from the Browns' 27, Vick fumbles and the Browns' Jereme Perry recovers it. Since the Falcons are out of timeouts, that pretty much seals the game for the Browns.\n\nSo, the final score is 17-13, Browns win.\n\nThe question is, how many points did Cleveland win by? It's 17-13, so that's 4 points.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst half: Browns 14, Falcons 3.\n\nThird quarter: Falcons score a touchdown, so it's 14-10.\n\nFourth quarter: Falcons kick a field goal, 14-13.\n\nThen Browns kick another field goal, 17-13.\n\nFinal score indeed 17-13.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Fran\u00e7ois, Madeleine's father, died on 16 February 1700, and his pension of 1000 livres was transferred to Madeleine due to her leadership in 1692, on the condition that she provide for her mother. Madeleine managed Verch\u00e8res until her marriage in September 1706 to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu de La P\u00e9rade, who was a lieutenant in the regular troops of New France.  He was the son of Thomas de Lanougu\u00e8re, an administrator of the colony who descended from an old noble family in France.  The couple moved to Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade, Quebec, where Tarieu was co-seigneur.  Madeleine's seigneury at Verch\u00e8res was transferred to her new husband.  The complex land titles led to numerous lawsuits over the course of her life, and Madeleine sailed to France at least three times to represent herself and her husband in court. Marie-Madeleine died at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade on 8 August 1747 at age 69.  She was buried beneath her pew at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade.  Pierre-Thomas died 26 January 1757 at age 79.How many years after Fran\u00e7ois' death did Marie-Madeleine get married?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text about Marie-Madeleine and her life, and there's a question: \"How many years after Fran\u00e7ois' death did Marie-Madeleine get married?\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find out when Fran\u00e7ois died and when Marie-Madeleine got married. According to the text, Fran\u00e7ois died on 16 February 1700. And she got married in September 1706. So, I need to calculate the difference between these two dates.\n\nLet's see, from February 1700 to September 1706. That's from February in one year to September in another year. How many full years are there between February 1700 and February 1706? That would be 6 years. Then, from February 1706 to September 1706, that's an additional 7 months.\n\nBut the question is about years, not months. So, it's 6 years and 7 months. But typically, when we're asked \"how many years,\" and it's not specified to round or anything, we might just say 6 years, considering that 7 months isn't a full year.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate it more precisely. There are 12 months in a year, so 7 months is 7/12 of a year. So, total time from Fran\u00e7ois' death to Marie-Madeleine's marriage is 6 years and 7 months, which is 6 + 7/12 years.\n\nBut since the question is likely expecting a whole number, maybe I should round it. 7 months is more than half a year, so perhaps I should round up to 7 years. But that doesn't seem right because from February 1700 to February 1706 is 6 years, and then 7 months more, so it's not a full 7 years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects exact years without considering the months. In that case, it's 6 years.\n\nLet me check the dates again to make sure. Fran\u00e7ois died on 16 February 1700, and she married in September 1706. So, from February 1700 to September 1706 is indeed 6 years and 7 months.\n\nIf I were to express this in years, it would be 6 + 7/12 years, which is approximately 6.583 years. But again, the question is probably looking for the number of full years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the marriage in 1706 as being in the 7th year after 1700. Because 1700 to 1701 is year 1, 1701 to 1702 is year 2, and so on, up to 1706, which would be year 7.\n\nWait a minute, that seems plausible. So, from 1700 to 1701 is one year, 1701 to 1702 is two years, and so on, up to 1706, which would be seven years.\n\nBut hold on, that would count 1700 and 1706 as two full years, which might not be accurate because she married in September 1706, not at the end of the year.\n\nAlternatively, if Fran\u00e7ois died in February 1700 and she married in September 1706, it's been 6 full years plus additional months.\n\nI think the most accurate way is to calculate the difference in years and then consider the months.\n\nSo, from February 1700 to February 1706 is exactly 6 years. Then, from February 1706 to September 1706 is 7 months.\n\nTherefore, she got married 6 years and 7 months after her father's death.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"how many years,\" so perhaps I should say 6 years.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that more than half a year is considered an additional year, then 7 months is more than half a year, so it could be rounded up to 7 years.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nMaybe I should look at the problem differently. Perhaps the question is considering the difference between the years 1700 and 1706, which is 6 years, regardless of the months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the difference using a date calculator.\n\nLet's try that. From February 16, 1700, to September, 1706.\n\nAssuming she married on September 1,\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan Coming off an impressive road performance against the Bengals, the Falcons flew to Ford Field for Week 9 as they took on the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Atlanta would trail early, as Lions kicker Jason Hanson would kick a 28-yard field goal, which would be followed up by a 35-yard TD run by RB Kevin Jones.  The Falcons would score on QB Michael Vick's 19-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler.  In the second quarter, Detroit would get Jones scoring a touchdown on a 2-yard run, while Atlanta had RB Warrick Dunn getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Hanson would get a 19-yard field goal for the Lions with the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Falcons would fall as QB Jon Kitna completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams and Hanson would kick a 36-yard field goal to end the game in favor of Detroit.  With the loss, the Falcons fell to 5-3.Who had the longest touchdown reception of the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Falcons and the Lions back in Week 9. It seems like it's from a while ago, but I need to focus on figuring out who had the longest touchdown reception in that game. Let's see what information is provided.\n\nFirst, it mentions that the Falcons came off an impressive road performance against the Bengals and then flew to Ford Field in Detroit to play the Lions. So, it's the Falcons versus the Lions, and the game is being played at the Lions' home stadium, Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nNow, let's look at the breakdown of the game by quarters to see all the scoring plays.\n\nIn the first quarter:\n\n- The Lions' kicker, Jason Hanson, kicked a 28-yard field goal. So, that's just a field goal, no touchdown here.\n\n- Then, Lions' running back, Kevin Jones, had a 35-yard touchdown run. Okay, so that's a rushing touchdown for Jones.\n\n- In response, the Falcons' quarterback, Michael Vick, threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Alge Crumpler. So, that's a passing touchdown, 19 yards.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter:\n\n- Again, Kevin Jones scored a touchdown for the Lions, this time on a 2-yard run. So, another rushing touchdown.\n\n- The Falcons had running back Warrick Dunn score a 1-yard touchdown run. Again, a rushing touchdown.\n\nThird quarter:\n\n- Jason Hanson kicked a 19-yard field goal for the Lions. Just a field goal.\n\nFourth quarter:\n\n- The Lions' quarterback, Jon Kitna, completed a 60-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams. So, that's a passing touchdown, 60 yards.\n\n- Finally, Hanson kicked a 36-yard field goal to end the game in favor of Detroit.\n\nAlright, so now I need to identify who had the longest touchdown reception in this game. Reception means a pass caught resulting in a touchdown.\n\nLooking back at the scoring plays:\n\n1. Falcons: Michael Vick to Alge Crumpler, 19 yards.\n\n2. Lions: Jon Kitna to Roy Williams, 60 yards.\n\nThose are the two passing touchdowns mentioned in the summary.\n\nSo, between 19 yards and 60 yards, clearly, the 60-yard pass from Kitna to Williams is the longer one.\n\nTherefore, Roy Williams had the longest touchdown reception of the game.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there were any other passing touchdowns that might have been longer. However, based on the provided text, these are the only two passing touchdowns mentioned.\n\nIt's also important to note that the question is specifically asking for the longest touchdown reception, not necessarily by a Falcon. So, even though the Falcons were the visiting team, I need to consider all touchdown receptions in the game.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there were any touchdowns on passes that were not mentioned, but since the question provides a summary of the scoring plays, I'll assume that all scoring plays are accounted for.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that there were no touchdown passes of longer yardage that weren't mentioned, but again, based on the information given, only these two passing touchdowns are described.\n\nSo, with that in mind, Roy Williams' 60-yard touchdown reception is the longest in this game.\n\nWait a minute, the question is phrased as \"Who had the longest touchdown reception of the game?\" and it's followed by \"Please solve the question above, then store the final answer in \\boxed{answer}.\"\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I'm providing the answer in the format requested.\n\nGiven that, I should box the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is Roy Williams.\n\nBut to be precise, since the box is to contain just the answer, perhaps it should be his name.\n\nHowever, sometimes in these kinds of formats, it might expect just the name or the entire phrase. But I think just the name is sufficient.\n\nSo, \\boxed{Roy Williams}\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any possibility that another player had a longer reception.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n- Falcons: Vick to Crumpler, 19 yards.\n\n- Lions: Kitna to Williams, 60 yards.\n\nNo other passing touchdowns are mentioned, so yes, Williams' 60-yard catch is indeed the longest.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web. Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash , Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours. In 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focussing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy to convert Flash animation to HTML5, a tool Google would use to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices. In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on all devices, however it will preserve the Flash-based video player for older web browsers.What event happened first, numerous businesses using Flash-based websites to launch new products, or Youtube switching to HTML5 technology?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here: \"What event happened first, numerous businesses using Flash-based websites to launch new products, or YouTube switching to HTML5 technology?\" I need to figure out which of these two events occurred earlier in time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand when businesses started using Flash-based websites to launch new products. The text says, \"Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals.\" So, it sounds like this was a practice that was common throughout that decade.\n\nOn the other hand, YouTube switching to HTML5 technology happened in 2015, according to the text: \"In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on all devices, however it will preserve the Flash-based video player for older web browsers.\"\n\nSo, comparing these two timeframes:\n\n- Businesses using Flash-based websites: between 2000 and 2010\n\n- YouTube switching to HTML5: in 2015\n\nClearly, the use of Flash-based websites by businesses started earlier, in the early 2000s, while YouTube's switch to HTML5 happened in 2015, which is after the period when businesses were using Flash.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is about which event happened first. One is a ongoing practice over several years, and the other is a specific switch in technology by YouTube in 2015.\n\nSo, the first event is something that started around 2000 and continued until 2010, while the second event is in 2015. Therefore, the first event happened first.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should check if there's any information that might suggest otherwise. Let's look back at the text.\n\nIt mentions that in 2005, YouTube was founded and used Flash Player to display videos. So, from 2005 to 2015, YouTube was using Flash Player.\n\nThen, in 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support iPhone and iPad, which didn't support Flash Player. So, even before 2015, YouTube was already providing HTML5 options for certain devices.\n\nBut the full switch to HTML5 on all devices happened in 2015.\n\nNow, comparing this to the use of Flash-based websites by businesses, which was between 2000 and 2010, it's clear that businesses were using Flash-based websites before YouTube switched to HTML5 in 2015.\n\nTherefore, the event that happened first is numerous businesses using Flash-based websites to launch new products.\n\nWait a minute, but YouTube offering HTML5 videos in 2007 is earlier than 2015. But the question is specifically about YouTube switching to HTML5 technology, which happened in 2015, not about when they started offering HTML5 videos.\n\nSo, even though YouTube offered HTML5 videos as an option in 2007, the complete switch to HTML5 across all devices occurred in 2015.\n\nTherefore, the use of Flash-based websites by businesses between 2000 and 2010 came before YouTube's full switch to HTML5 in 2015.\n\nHence, the answer is that numerous businesses using Flash-based websites to launch new products happened first.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look back at the key dates:\n\n- Businesses using Flash-based websites: 2000-2010\n\n- YouTube offering HTML5 videos for iPhone/iPad: 2007\n\n- YouTube fully switching to HTML5: 2015\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The population doubled by 1978, and the population growth rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968, although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.How many years did the life expectancy increase by?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here with a bunch of statistics about population growth, life expectancy, and other demographics. The question is asking how many years the life expectancy increased by. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to find the initial and final life expectancy values from the text. Looking at the text, it says: \"Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72.\" So, in 1978, life expectancy was 46 years, and it increased to 72 years at some point.\n\nThe question is asking for how many years the life expectancy increased by, which means I need to find the difference between the final and initial life expectancy.\n\nSo, final life expectancy is 72 years, initial is 46 years. The increase is 72 - 46 = 26 years.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's any other information that affects this calculation.\n\nLooking back at the text, it mentions life expectancy at birth in 1978 was 46 years, and it later rose to 72. It doesn't specify the year when it reached 72, but the question is just about the increase in life expectancy, not the time period over which it increased.\n\nSo, the increase is indeed 26 years.\n\nBut to make sure, let's see if there's any other relevant information. The text mentions that the population doubled by 1978, population growth rates, census data from 2006 and 2000, and a projection for 2010. But for life expectancy, only the 1978 and later (72 years) figures are provided.\n\nInfant mortality and literacy rates are also mentioned, but they don't affect the life expectancy calculation.\n\nCombined school enrollment is mentioned, but again, not relevant to life expectancy increase.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

The population density was 221 people per square mile (85/km\u00b2).  There were 102,830 housing units at an average density of 108 per square mile (42/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the county was 87.46% Race (United States Census), 8.31% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.33% Race (United States Census), 0.79% Race (United States Census), 0.04% Race (United States Census), 1.88% from Race (United States Census), and 1.18% from two or more races.  5.61% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race.How many more people are there than households?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here from a census, and it's giving me some numbers about people, households, and families in a county. The question is asking me to find out how many more people there are than households. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant numbers from the text. It says there were 210,528 people, 88,413 households, and 62,507 families. So, the key numbers for this question are the number of people and the number of households.\n\nThe question is asking for how many more people there are than households. That means I need to subtract the number of households from the number of people.\n\nSo, people minus households: 210,528 - 88,413.\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n210,528\n\nMinus 88,413\n\n__________\n\nLet's see, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n8 - 3 = 5\n\n2 - 1 = 1 (since 5 is greater than 4, no borrowing needed)\n\n5 - 4 = 1\n\n0 - 8, but 0 is less than 8, so I need to borrow from the next digit.\n\nThe next digit is 1 (in the thousands place), so I'll make it 0 and add 10 to the hundreds place, making it 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nThen, in the thousands place, it's now 0 - 8, but again, 0 is less than 8, so I need to borrow from the ten-thousands place.\n\nThe ten-thousands digit is 1, which becomes 0, and the thousands place becomes 10.\n\nSo, 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nFinally, in the hundred-thousands place, 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 210,528 - 88,413 = 122,115.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a different method or double-check with a calculator if possible, but since I'm supposed to do this manually, I'll try again.\n\n210,528\n\nMinus 88,413\n\n__________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 - 3 = 5\n\n2 - 1 = 1\n\n5 - 4 = 1\n\n0 - 8: borrow 1 from the next higher digit, so 10 - 8 = 2\n\n1 (from the thousands place, now 0 after borrowing) - 8: need to borrow again, so 10 - 8 = 2\n\n2 (from the hundred-thousands place, now 1 after borrowing) - 0 = 2\n\nSo, 210,528 - 88,413 = 122,115.\n\nWait, but that still seems off. Let me verify with another method.\n\nI can add 88,413 to 122,115 and see if I get back to 210,528.\n\n88,413 + 122,115.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n3 + 5 = 8\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n4 + 1 = 5\n\n8 + 2 = 10, carry over 1\n\n8 + 2 = 10, plus the carried-over 1 makes 11, carry over 1\n\nFinally, 8 + 1 = 9, plus the carried-over 1 makes 10.\n\nSo, writing it down: 10 from the left, then 1 from the carry-over, then 0, then 5, then 2, then 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me add them properly.\n\n88,413\n\n+122,115\n\n__________\n\n3 + 5 = 8\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n4 + 1 = 5\n\n8 + 2 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n\n8 + 2 = 10, plus the carried-over 1 makes 11, write down 1, carry over 1\n\nFinally, there's only 1 from the hundred-thousands place plus the carried-over 1, making 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 210,528.\n\nOkay, so 88,413 + 122,115 = 210,5\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to rebound from a tough loss to the Patriots, the Bills would play their Week 2 home opener in an interconference duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This would be the first time that Buffalo ever hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, having played a preseason game with each other in 1977. In the first quarter, the Bills came out firing as quarterback Trent Edwards completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans, safety Donte Whitner returning an interception 76 yards for a touchdown and kicker Rian Lindell making a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers would get on the board in the second quarter as quarterback Byron Leftwich completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, while Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 43-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would close out the half as Leftwich completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. After a scoreless third quarter, the Bills began to pull away as Lindell got a 43-yard field goal and Edwards completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Buccaneers tried to rally as Leftwich completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens (with a failed two-point conversion), yet Buffalo closed out the game with Lindell nailing a 20-yard field goal. With the win, the Bills improved to 1-1.In which quarter were no points scored?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It's from Week 2 of their season, and it's their home opener. The Bills were looking to bounce back from a tough loss to the Patriots. The article mentions that this was the first time they hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, except for a preseason game way back in 1977.\n\nAlright, let's dive into the game breakdown. In the first quarter, the Bills really came out strong. Their quarterback, Trent Edwards, threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans. Then, safety Donte Whitner made an interception and ran it back 76 yards for another touchdown. On top of that, kicker Rian Lindell made a 31-yard field goal. So, in the first quarter alone, the Bills scored a touchdown, another touchdown from an interception, and a field goal.\n\nThe Buccaneers finally got on the board in the second quarter. Their quarterback, Byron Leftwich, threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. The Bills responded with Lindell making a 43-yard field goal. Then, Tampa Bay scored again with Leftwich throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. So, in the second quarter, both teams scored.\n\nMoving on to the third quarter, it says here that it was scoreless. So, neither team scored any points in the third quarter.\n\nThen, in the fourth quarter, the Bills started to pull away. Lindell kicked another 43-yard field goal, and Edwards threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Buccaneers tried to rally, with Leftwich throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens, but the two-point conversion failed. Finally, Lindell sealed the game with a 20-yard field goal.\n\nThe article concludes that the Bills improved to 1-1 with this win.\n\nNow, the question is: In which quarter were no points scored?\n\nFrom the breakdown, it's clear that:\n\n- First quarter: Bills scored multiple times.\n\n- Second quarter: Both teams scored.\n\n- Third quarter: No points scored.\n\n- Fourth quarter: Both teams scored.\n\nSo, the answer should be the third quarter.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure. The text says, \"After a scoreless third quarter,\" which directly indicates that no points were scored in the third quarter.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos traveled to Gillette Stadium to play the New England Patriots during the Sunday night game on September 24. The game was a rematch of the divisional playoff game of the previous season in which the Broncos beat the Patriots and ended their record 10-game playoff winning streak.  The Broncos won 17-7, improving their record to 2-1.  The Broncos scored a 23-yard field goal (by kicker Jason Elam) and a touchdown in the second quarter (a 32-yard TD pass from QB Jake Plummer to Javon Walker). Plummer and Walker would hook up for another touchdown in the fourth quarter with an 83-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos held New England to only 50 yards on the ground, while Tatum Bell ran for 123 yards. The Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when Tom Brady threw an 8-yard pass to Doug Gabriel. The Broncos became the first team since the 1942 Chicago Cardinals to begin their season with 11 straight quarters without allowing their opponents to score a touchdown.How many more touchdown passes did Jake Plummer make over Tom Brady?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Broncos and the New England Patriots. It's from way back in 2005, specifically on September 24th. The game was a rematch of the previous season's divisional playoff where the Broncos had beaten the Patriots, ending their 10-game playoff winning streak. So, it's a pretty significant game.\n\nAlright, so in this particular game, the Broncos won 17-7, and their record went to 2-1. Let's see what happened in the game. The Broncos scored a 23-yard field goal by kicker Jason Elam and a touchdown in the second quarter with a 32-yard TD pass from QB Jake Plummer to Javon Walker. Then, in the fourth quarter, Plummer and Walker connected again for another touchdown with an 83-yard pass. So, that's two touchdown passes by Plummer to Walker.\n\nOn the other side, the Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when Tom Brady threw an 8-yard pass to Doug Gabriel. So, Brady had one touchdown pass.\n\nThe question is asking how many more touchdown passes Jake Plummer made over Tom Brady. So, Plummer had two touchdown passes, and Brady had one. So, Plummer made one more touchdown pass than Brady.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe article mentions that the Broncos held the Patriots to only 50 yards on the ground, while Tatum Bell ran for 123 yards. But that doesn't affect the touchdown passes.\n\nAlso, it notes that the Broncos had 11 straight quarters without allowing their opponents to score a touchdown, which is a record or something. But again, that's not relevant to the touchdown passes.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their road win over the Panthers, the Eagles played their Week 2 home opener against the New Orleans Saints.  Due to the rib injury to quarterback Donovan McNabb, backup quarterback Kevin Kolb was named the starter. In the first quarter, Philadelphia trailed as Saints quarterback Drew Brees completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston.  The Eagles would answer with Kolb completing a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson, but New Orleans replied with kicker John Carney making a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal.  However, the Saints struck back as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 25-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans began to pull away as Brees completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans, along with running back Mike Bell getting a 7-yard touchdown.  Philadelphia would answer with Kolb completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jason Avant.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued to pull away as running back Reggie Bush got a 19-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would get a score as Brees fumbled the ball out of his own end zone, giving Philadelphia a safety.  However, the Saints closed out their victory march as safety Darren Sharper returned an interception 97 yards for a touchdown.How many field goals over 23 yards were made before the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Eagles and the Saints. It's from way back in 2009, and it's detailing all the scores in the game. The question is asking for the number of field goals over 23 yards made before the third quarter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a field goal is. In American football, a field goal is when the kicking team scores three points by placing the ball on the ground and kicking it through the opponent's goalposts. The distance of the field goal refers to how far the ball was from the goalposts when it was kicked.\n\nSo, the question is specifically asking for field goals over 23 yards made before the third quarter. That means I need to look at all the field goals kicked in the first half (quarters 1 and 2) and count only those that were longer than 23 yards.\n\nLet me read through the text again and identify all the field goals mentioned.\n\nIn the first quarter:\n\n- The Saints' kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal.\n\n- The Eagles' kicker David Akers made a 23-yard field goal.\n\nIn the second quarter:\n\n- David Akers made a 32-yard field goal.\n\nThat's all the field goals mentioned in the first half.\n\nNow, the question is asking for field goals over 23 yards made before the third quarter. So, I need to exclude any field goals that were 23 yards or less.\n\nLooking at the field goals:\n\n1. John Carney's 23-yard field goal for the Saints.\n\n2. David Akers' 23-yard field goal for the Eagles.\n\n3. David Akers' 32-yard field goal for the Eagles.\n\nSo, the first two field goals are exactly 23 yards, which means they are not over 23 yards. The third one is 32 yards, which is over 23 yards.\n\nTherefore, only one field goal was made over 23 yards before the third quarter: David Akers' 32-yard field goal in the second quarter.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The question says \"over 23 yards,\" which means greater than 23 yards, so 23 yards itself doesn't count. So, only the 32-yard field goal qualifies.\n\nIs there any other field goal in the first half that I might have missed? Let me read the text again.\n\nFirst quarter:\n\n- Saints: TD pass from Brees to Colston for 15 yards.\n\n- Eagles: TD pass from Kolb to Jackson for 71 yards.\n\n- Saints: Field goal by Carney for 23 yards.\n\n- Eagles: Field goal by Akers for 23 yards.\n\nSecond quarter:\n\n- Eagles: Field goal by Akers for 32 yards.\n\n- Saints: TD pass from Brees to Colston for 25 yards.\n\n- Eagles: Field goal by Akers for 32 yards.\n\nWait, actually, in the second quarter, it mentions Akers making a 32-yard field goal. But then it mentions another score, which is a touchdown pass from Kolb to Avant for 3 yards.\n\nIs there another field goal in the second quarter? Let me check the text again.\n\n\"In the second quarter, Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal. However, the Saints replied as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 25-yard touchdown pass. The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo, in the second quarter, Akers made one field goal of 32 yards. The 23-yard field goal was in the first quarter.\n\nSo, before the third quarter, there were two field goals over 23 yards:\n\n1. Akers' 32-yard field goal in the second quarter.\n\nIs there another one? Wait, earlier I thought only one, but now I'm thinking maybe there's another.\n\nWait, no. The only field goals mentioned are:\n\n- First quarter: Carney 23 yards, Akers 23 yards.\n\n- Second quarter: Akers 32 yards.\n\nSo, only one field goal over 23 yards before the third quarter.\n\nBut wait, it's possible I missed another one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n\"Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal.\"\n\nThat's the first quarter.\n\n\"However, the Saints replied as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 25-yard touchdown pass.\"\n\nThen, \"The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo, the only field goals before the third\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement: Hoping to increase their winning streak the Bears returned to Chicago for an NFC duel with the Seattle Seahawks. The Bears took the early lead as RB Matt Forte got a six-yard TD run. But the Seahawks answered back with QB Matt Hasselbeck getting a 22-yard TD pass to WR Deon Butler, followed in the second quarter by RB Justin Forsett getting a 9-yard TD run. Then the Bears responded with kicker Robbie Gould making a 34 and a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Bears fell further behind when QB Jay Cutler was sacked in the endzone by free safety Jordan Babineaux for a safety. This was followed in the fourth quarter by RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run. The Bears tried to come back into the game but only came away with a touchdown after WR Devin Hester returned a punt 89 yards to the endzone for a touchdown.How many yards longer was Robbie Gould's longest field goal than his shortest?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Bears and the Seahawks. It seems like there's a bunch of scoring going on, but the actual question is about Robbie Gould's field goals. Specifically, it asks how many yards longer his longest field goal was compared to his shortest one.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the field goals that Robbie Gould made during the game. According to the text, \"Then the Bears responded with kicker Robbie Gould making a 34 and a 24-yard field goal.\" So, Robbie Gould made two field goals: one from 34 yards and another from 24 yards.\n\nNow, I need to determine which one is the longest and which one is the shortest. Clearly, 34 yards is longer than 24 yards. So, the longest field goal is 34 yards, and the shortest is 24 yards.\n\nThe question is asking for how many yards longer the longest field goal is compared to the shortest one. So, I need to subtract the shortest distance from the longest distance.\n\nThat would be:\n\n34 yards - 24 yards = 10 yards\n\nSo, Robbie Gould's longest field goal was 10 yards longer than his shortest one.\n\nI should probably double-check if there are any other field goals mentioned that I might have missed. Let's scan the text again:\n\n\"Hoping to increase their winning streak the Bears returned to Chicago for an NFC duel with the Seattle Seahawks.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \"Big Three\" coming together during the course of the 2010\u201311 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility.How many points did Dirk Nowitzki average in the series?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about the 2011 NBA Finals between the Mavericks and the Heat. It's pretty detailed, but I need to find out how many points Dirk Nowitzki averaged per game in that series. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Mavericks were underdogs because Miami had their \"Big Three,\" which probably refers to LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. The series seems to have been back and forth, with the Mavericks coming back from deficits in some games and making big comebacks, especially in game 2.\n\nLooking at the text, it mentions specific games and scores:\n\n- Game 1: Mavericks lost 92-84 in Miami.\n\n- Game 2: Mavericks came back from a 88-73 deficit to win.\n\n- Game 3: Lost 88-86 at home.\n\n- Game 4: Won with Nowitzki making big shots down the stretch.\n\n- Game 5: Both teams scored over 100 points for the first time in the series; Mavericks won 112-103.\n\n- Game 6: Mavericks won 105-95 to clinch the title.\n\nSo, the series went to six games, with the Mavericks winning four of them.\n\nNow, focusing on Nowitzki's performance. The text says that in game 6, he scored 21 points, with 18 in the second half, and in game 5, he scored 26 points. Wait, no, in game 6, he scored 21, and the text mentions he averaged 26 points a game during the series. Hmm, that seems contradictory at first glance, but maybe I need to read carefully.\n\nLet me look again: \"Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series...\" So, it directly states that he averaged 26 points per game in the series.\n\nBut wait, in game 6, he scored 21 points, and in game 5, 26. Maybe those are specific game scores, and the average is given separately.\n\nWait, no, it says, \"Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series...\"\n\nSo, it's clear that his average was 26 points per game in the series.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 26.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other information that might suggest a different average.\n\nLooking back, in game 6, he scored 21, and in game 5, 26. Maybe the text is summing up his performance, but it explicitly says \"averaging 26 points a game during the series.\"\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:During the 15th century the Ayutthaya Kingdom fought frequent wars against the Lan Na Kingdom in the north, the Khmer Empire of Angkor Wat to the east and the Malay States to the south. King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh. The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441. Thao Lok was crowned as king Tilokaraj of Lan na, later banishing his father Sam Fang Kaen to Muong Shan in the Shan States. General Phya Samdekyoki, who had previously played an important role in bringing Tilokaraj to power created a plot in order to assume power himself, the plot was however discovered and Samdekyoki was exiled to Chiang Saen.How many sons did Sam Fang Kaen have before Thao Lok?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I'm trying to figure out how many sons Sam Fang Kaen had before Thao Lok. Let's see what the text says.\n\nIt mentions that Thao Lok was the sixth son of Sam Fang Kaen. So if he was the sixth son, that means Sam Fang Kaen had five sons before him, right? Because sixth comes after five.\n\nLet me just double-check. If you count sons, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and then sixth, so Thao Lok being the sixth means there are five others before him.\n\nSo, the number of sons Sam Fang Kaen had before Thao Lok is five.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other information in the text that might suggest otherwise? Let's read the relevant part again.\n\n\"the sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441.\"\n\nYes, that's clear. Thao Lok was the sixth son.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Buccaneers, the Titans flew to Reliant Stadium for a Week 7 AFC South showdown with the Houston Texans. With Vince Young recovering from a quad injury, back-up QB Kerry Collins was given the start. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 52-yard field goal. The Texans would respond with LB DeMeco Ryans returning a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Titans answered with Bironas kicking a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Tennessee began to pound away as Bironas got a 21-yard field goal, while RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Bironas would end the half with a 30-yard and a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Titans continued its domination with Bironas kicking a 43-yard field goal, while rookie RB Chris Henry got a 4-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. Afterwards, Tennessee managed to reply. With Bironas' 29-yard field goal, he became the 5th kicker in NFL history to get 7 field goals in one game. However, the Texans managed to retake the lead with Rosenfels completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jeb Putzier and a 53-yard TD pass to WR Andr&#233; Davis. Fortunately, the Titans managed to get a historic last-second field goal. With his 29-yard field goal, not only did it seal the win for Tennessee, but it made Rob Bironas the first kicker in NFL history to get 8 field goals in one game.Which player had the longest TD pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this football game to analyze. It's between the Titans and the Texans in Week 7 of the AFC South showdown. The Titans were coming off a loss to the Buccaneers and their starting QB, Vince Young, was injured, so Kerry Collins was starting instead.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Titans got on the board first with a 52-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. Then, the Texans responded with a 26-yard touchdown run by LB DeMeco Ryans, who returned a fumble. After that, the Titans kicked another field goal, this one from 25 yards. So, it seems like the Titans are relying heavily on field goals.\n\nMoving to the second quarter, Tennessee kept up the pressure with a 21-yard field goal and a 1-yard touchdown run by RB LenDale White. Before halftime, Bironas kicked two more field goals, from 30 and 28 yards. So, by halftime, it looks like the Titans have been consistent with their field goals.\n\nIn the third quarter, they continued their approach with a 43-yard field goal and a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Chris Henry. It seems like the running game is effective, with both White and Henry getting scores.\n\nBut in the fourth quarter, the Texans started to rally. Their QB, Sage Rosenfels, threw a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and another one, 6 yards, to WR Kevin Walter. The Titans responded with another field goal by Bironas, this one from 29 yards, which was significant because it was his seventh field goal of the game, making him the fifth kicker in NFL history to achieve that.\n\nHowever, the Texans didn't give up and scored two more touchdowns: Rosenfels threw a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jeb Putzier and a longer one, 53 yards, to WR Andr\u00e9 Davis. This seemed to give the Texans the lead.\n\nBut then, in a dramatic finish, the Titans managed to get another field goal, again from 29 yards by Bironas, which not only sealed the win but also made him the first kicker in NFL history to make eight field goals in a single game. That's pretty impressive.\n\nNow, the question is asking which player had the longest touchdown pass. From what I can see, there were several touchdown passes mentioned:\n\n1. Sage Rosenfels to David Anderson: 7 yards\n\n2. Sage Rosenfels to Kevin Walter: 6 yards\n\n3. Sage Rosenfels to Jeb Putzier: 7 yards\n\n4. Sage Rosenfels to Andr\u00e9 Davis: 53 yards\n\nSo, among these, the longest touchdown pass is 53 yards to Andr\u00e9 Davis by Sage Rosenfels.\n\nWait a minute, was there any other touchdown pass in the game? Let me check again.\n\nIn the Texans' responses:\n\n- DeMeco Ryans' 26-yard fumble return touchdown (which is not a pass)\n\n- Rosenfels to Anderson: 7 yards\n\n- Rosenfels to Walter: 6 yards\n\n- Rosenfels to Putzier: 7 yards\n\n- Rosenfels to Davis: 53 yards\n\nAnd in the Titans' scores:\n\n- LenDale White's 1-yard TD run\n\n- Chris Henry's 4-yard TD run\n\n- No passing touchdowns for the Titans mentioned in the text.\n\nSo, it seems like all the passing touchdowns were by Rosenfels for the Texans, and the longest among those is the 53-yard pass to Andr\u00e9 Davis.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After a tough loss on Monday Night Football, the Bengals returned home for Week 2 against the Browns.  The Bengals were able to get the first points on the board with Adam \"Pacman\" Jones returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown for a 7-0 lead.  The Browns then shortened their lead to 4 points with Phil Dawson's 50-yard field goal to make the score 7-3.  The Bengals then moved ahead by 11 points as Andy Dalton found A. J. Green on a 10-yard touchdown pass for a 14-3 lead, however the Browns again came within 4 as Trent Richardson ran for a touchdown from 32 yards out.  The Bengals then moved ahead 17-10 with Mike Nugent's 39-yard field goal before halftime.  Coming back, the Bengals increased their lead with Dalton finding Brandon Tate on a 44-yard pass for a 24-10 lead.  However, The Browns drew closer as Brandon Weeden found Richardson on a 23-yard pass to shorten the game to 24-17.  Then the Bengals moved up in the 4th quarter as Dalton found Andrew Hawkins on a 50-yard touchdown pass for a 31-17 lead but the Browns came within a touchdown after Weeden found Greg Little on a 24-yard pass to make the score 31-24.  Mike Nugent then nailed a 37-yard field goal to give the Bengals a 34-24 lead then the Browns wrapped things up as Phil Dawson scored a 25-yard field goal for a final score of 34-27.How many total field goal yards were made before halftime by anyone?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Bengals and the Browns. It's from Week 2, and it mentions some scores and plays. The question is asking for the total field goal yards made before halftime by anyone. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the field goals that were made before halftime. The text provides a play-by-play summary, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\nStarting with the beginning:\n\n- The Bengals scored first with a 81-yard punt return for a touchdown by Adam \"Pacman\" Jones. That's a touchdown, not a field goal, so I can ignore that for this question.\n\n- Next, the Browns shortened their lead with a 50-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. Okay, this is a field goal, and it's 50 yards. So, I'll note that down.\n\n- Then, the Bengals increased their lead with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton to A.J. Green. Again, a touchdown, not a field goal.\n\n- After that, the Browns scored a touchdown with a 32-yard run by Trent Richardson. Another touchdown, not a field goal.\n\n- The Bengals then made a 39-yard field goal by Mike Nugent before halftime. So, that's another field goal.\n\nAlright, so before halftime, there are two field goals mentioned: one by Phil Dawson for 50 yards and one by Mike Nugent for 39 yards.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total field goal yards made before halftime by anyone. So, I need to add up the yards of these two field goals.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n50 yards + 39 yards = 89 yards\n\nSo, the total field goal yards before halftime are 89 yards.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check if there were any other field goals before halftime. Let's scan the text again.\n\nThe plays mentioned before halftime are:\n\n1. Bengals: 81-yard punt return TD\n\n2. Browns: 50-yard field goal by Dawson\n\n3. Bengals: 10-yard TD pass from Dalton to Green\n\n4. Browns: 32-yard TD run by Richardson\n\n5. Bengals: 39-yard field goal by Nugent\n\nAfter that, it says \"before halftime,\" and then moves on to the second half.\n\nSo, yes, only those two field goals before halftime.\n\nTherefore, the total field goal yards before halftime are 89 yards.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nSometimes, there might be extra points or other scoring plays, but the question specifically asks for field goal yards before halftime.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, I'll check if there's any information about overtime or anything, but it seems like it's a standard game with halftime.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Trying to snap a five-game losing skid, the Panthers stayed at home for a Week 13 intraconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with kicker John Kasay nailing a 19-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Panthers increased their lead with QB Vinny Testaverde completing a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Dante Rosario, while CB Richard Marshall returned an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the 49ers managed to get on the board as QB Trent Dilfer completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle and a 1-yard TD pass to TE Delanie Walker. Afterwards, Carolina went back to work as RB DeShaun Foster got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers pulled away as Testaverde completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King. With the win, not only did Carolina improve to 5-7, but it even managed to give the Panthers their first home win of the year.How many 1 yard TDs were there?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Panthers and the 49ers. The Panthers were trying to break a five-game losing streak, and this was an important game for them. The text goes through each quarter and describes the scoring plays. My task is to figure out how many 1-yard touchdown passes there were in the game.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully and identify all the touchdown plays that were mentioned, specifically focusing on those that were 1-yard passes.\n\nLet's start with the first quarter. It says that the Panthers scored first with a 19-yard field goal by John Kasay, and that was the only score of the period. So, no touchdowns in the first quarter.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter. The Panthers increased their lead with a few scores. First, QB Vinny Testaverde completed a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Dante Rosario. That's a touchdown, but it's 5 yards, not 1 yard. Next, CB Richard Marshall returned an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. Again, that's a touchdown, but it's a interception return, not a pass, and it's 67 yards, not 1 yard. So, no 1-yard TD passes in the second quarter.\n\nNow, the third quarter. The 49ers scored two touchdowns. First, QB Trent Dilfer completed a 20-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle. That's 20 yards, not 1 yard. Then, Dilfer completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Delanie Walker. Ah, here's one! That's a 1-yard TD pass. So, that's the first 1-yard TD pass.\n\nAfter that, the Panthers scored again. RB DeShaun Foster got a 1-yard TD run. That's a 1-yard run, but it's not a pass. So, it doesn't count for our purpose.\n\nFinally, in the fourth quarter, the Panthers pulled away with another touchdown. Testaverde completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King. That's another 1-yard TD pass.\n\nSo, let's tally them up. There were two 1-yard TD passes: one by Dilfer to Walker in the third quarter, and one by Testaverde to King in the fourth quarter.\n\nWait a minute, the question asks for the number of 1-yard TDs, but it doesn't specify whether it's only passes or including runs as well. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: \"How many 1 yard TDs were there?\" It doesn't specify pass or run, so I should consider all touchdown plays that were 1 yard, regardless of whether they were passes or runs.\n\nIn that case, there are three 1-yard touchdowns:\n\n1. Dilfer to Walker (pass)\n\n2. Foster's run\n\n3. Testaverde to King (pass)\n\nSo, total of three 1-yard touchdowns.\n\nBut to make sure, let's double-check the text.\n\nFirst quarter: No touchdowns.\n\nSecond quarter: Testaverde to Rosario (5 yards), Marshall interception return (67 yards).\n\nThird quarter: Dilfer to Battle (20 yards), Dilfer to Walker (1 yard), Foster run (1 yard).\n\nFourth quarter: Testaverde to King (1 yard).\n\nSo, yes, three 1-yard touchdowns: two passes and one run.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be three.\n\nWait, but the question specifically says \"TDs\", which typically stands for touchdown passes, but in football, TD can refer to any touchdown, not just passes. So, to be precise, I think it's referring to all touchdown plays, not just passes.\n\nGiven that, the three 1-yard touchdowns should be counted.\n\nHowever, perhaps the \"TD\" in football shorthand often refers to passing touchdowns, but I think in this context, it's safe to assume it means any touchdown play.\n\nTo be extra sure, maybe I should consider the context in which \"TD\" is used in the text.\n\nLooking back, the text mentions \"TD pass\" specifically when it's a passing touchdown, and \"TD run\" when it's a running touchdown.\n\nSo, when it says \"TD pass\", it's specifying that it's a pass, and similarly for runs.\n\nBut in the question, it just says \"1 yard TDs\", without specifying pass or run, so it should include both passes and runs that are 1 yard.\n\nTherefore, all three touchdowns that were 1 yard should be counted.\n\nAlternatively, if \"TD\" is being used to mean only passing touchdowns, then it would be two.\n\nBut given the context, I think it's safer to assume it includes both passes and runs.\n\nSo, my final answer is three.\n\nWait, but the question is: \"How many 1 yard TDs were\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying $40,000 for his flight. NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200-300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttles cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.How many fewer dollars would people pay in 15 years to travel to space over the initial cost per person at the smallest estimate?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about space tourism and costs over time. It mentions that in 1984, Charles D. Walker was the first non-government astronaut to fly, and his employer paid $40,000 for his flight. Then it talks about different proposals for carrying more passengers on the Shuttle, with estimates of how many people could be accommodated and for how long.\n\nBut the actual question is: \"How many fewer dollars would people pay in 15 years to travel to space over the initial cost per person at the smallest estimate?\"\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the initial cost per person is and what the cost would be in 15 years, then find the difference.\n\nFrom the text, it says that flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, and that within 15 years, 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft.\n\nSo, the initial cost is $1 to 1.5 million, and the smallest estimate is $1 million. In 15 years, the cost would be $25,000 per person.\n\nI need to find how many fewer dollars that is, meaning the difference between the initial cost and the future cost.\n\nSo, initial cost: $1,000,000\n\nFuture cost: $25,000\n\nDifference: $1,000,000 - $25,000 = $975,000\n\nTherefore, people would pay $975,000 fewer dollars in 15 years.\n\nWait, but the question says \"at the smallest estimate.\" Does that mean I should consider the initial cost to be $1 million, which is the smallest estimate in the range of $1 to 1.5 million?\n\nYes, I think that makes sense.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Starting lineups: HOUSTON - OFFENSE: QB Matt Schaub, LT Duane Brown, LG Wade Smith, C Chris Myers, RG Mike Brisiel, RT Eric Winston, WR Andre Johnson, RB Arian Foster, FB Vonta Leach, TE Joel Dreessen, WR Kevin Walter.Hoping to snap a four-game losing streak the Texans played on home ground for an AFC South rivalry match against the Titans.  The Texans took control throughout the game as QB Matt Schaub got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen, followed by his 2-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The lead was increased when kicker Neil Rackers hit a 35 and a 33-yard field goal. With the easy win, the Texans improved to 5-6.  However, Johnson was ejected following a fight with Titans CB Cortland Finnegan, who was also ejected.How many wins did the Texans have after the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about the Houston Texans football team. They were in a bit of a slump, having lost four games in a row, and they were playing against their rivals, the Titans, in an AFC South matchup at their home field. The starting lineup is listed, which seems pretty standard for their offense.\n\nThe text says they were hoping to snap a four-game losing streak, so before this game, they must have had some wins and losses. It mentions that with an easy win in this game, they improved to 5-6. So, I need to figure out how many wins they had before this game and then after.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"improved to 5-6\" means. In sports, the record is usually presented as wins minus losses, so 5-6 means 5 wins and 6 losses up to that point in the season.\n\nSince they were on a four-game losing streak before this game, that means they had lost their previous four games. So, before this game, their record would have been 5 wins and 2 losses plus those 4 losses, which would make it 5-6 if they win this game.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If they had 5 wins and 2 losses before losing four games, that would mean they had 5 wins and 6 losses before this game, and then winning this game would bring them to 6-6. But the text says they improved to 5-6 with this win, which seems contradictory.\n\nLet me read it again. \"With the easy win, the Texans improved to 5-6.\" So, after winning this game, their record is 5 wins and 6 losses.\n\nThat means before this game, they must have had 4 wins and 6 losses. Then, winning this game brings them up to 5-6.\n\nWait, but the text says they were on a four-game losing streak, which means they had lost their last four games before this one. So, if they had 4 wins and 6 losses before this game, and they win this game, their record becomes 5-6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, before the game, they had 4 wins and 6 losses, and after winning this game, it's 5 wins and 6 losses.\n\nThe question is: How many wins did the Texans have after the game?\n\nWell, according to the text, they improved to 5-6, so they had 5 wins after the game.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they had 4 wins and 6 losses before the game, and they win this game, their record becomes 5-6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 5 wins.\n\nBut the question is: How many wins did the Texans have after the game?\n\nSo, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but in sports, sometimes records include the current game. Let me make sure.\n\nThey had 4 wins and 6 losses before this game. They win this game, so their total wins become 5.\n\nTherefore, after the game, they have 5 wins.\n\nI think that's the straightforward answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nThe text says \"improved to 5-6 with this win,\" which clearly indicates that their record after the game is 5 wins and 6 losses.\n\nSo, no ambiguity there.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In the county, the age distribution of the population shows 27.90% under the age of 18, 6.80% from 18 to 24, 31.60% from 25 to 44, 23.70% from 45 to 64, and 10.10% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 96.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.50 males.Which age group is smaller: 25 to 44 or 45 to 64?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this age distribution data for a county, and I need to figure out which age group is smaller: 25 to 44 or 45 to 64. Let's see what the percentages are for each group.\n\nFirst, looking at the percentages:\n\n- Under 18: 27.90%\n\n- 18 to 24: 6.80%\n\n- 25 to 44: 31.60%\n\n- 45 to 64: 23.70%\n\n- 65 and over: 10.10%\n\nSo, the age group 25 to 44 has 31.60%, and 45 to 64 has 23.70%. Comparing these two percentages, 23.70% is less than 31.60%, which means the 45 to 64 age group is smaller than the 25 to 44 age group.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check if there's any other information given that could affect this conclusion. The text also provides the median age, which is 36 years, and some gender ratios, but for this particular question, I think the percentages are sufficient.\n\nWait, the question is asking for which age group is smaller, and based on the percentages, it's the 45 to 64 group. But maybe I should consider the actual number of people instead of percentages if the total population is known. However, the question doesn't provide the total population, so I have to work with the given percentages.\n\nAlso, the median age is 36, which falls within the 25 to 44 age group, but that doesn't directly help in comparing the sizes of the 25-44 and 45-64 groups.\n\nMoreover, the gender ratios are provided: for every 100 females, there are 96.00 males overall, and for every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 92.50 males. But since the question is about age groups, not gender, I think I can ignore these ratios for this particular question.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the age group 25 to 44 has 31.60% of the population, and 45 to 64 has 23.70%. Since 23.70% is less than 31.60%, the 45 to 64 age group is smaller.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but it's always good to double-check.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In Ancient Egypt the Bronze Age begins in the Protodynastic period, c.\u20093150 BC. The archaic early Bronze Age of Egypt, known as the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt, immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, c.\u20093100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Abydos to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. Memphis in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.The Old Kingdom of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement - the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley . The First Intermediate Period of Egypt, often described as a \"dark period\" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt and Thebes in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in the reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.Which began first in Egypt, the Bronze Age or the Old Kingdom?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here: \"Which began first in Egypt, the Bronze Age or the Old Kingdom?\" I have a text that provides some information about the timelines of different periods in ancient Egyptian history. Let's see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that the Bronze Age in Ancient Egypt begins in the Protodynastic period, around 3150 BC. Okay, so the Bronze Age starts around 3150 BC.\n\nNext, it talks about the Early Dynastic Period, which includes the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from around 3100 BC to about 2686 BC. This period follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt.\n\nThen, it mentions the Old Kingdom, which is part of the regional Bronze Age in the 3rd millennium BC. The Old Kingdom is described as starting around 2686 BC.\n\nWait a minute, the Bronze Age starts around 3150 BC, and the Old Kingdom starts around 2686 BC. So, the Bronze Age begins first, followed by the Old Kingdom.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. The Protodynastic period marks the beginning of the Bronze Age around 3150 BC, and then the Early Dynastic Period follows from around 3100 BC to 2686 BC. After that comes the Old Kingdom starting around 2686 BC.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their win over the Jaguars the Chiefs played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Bills. Late in the second quarter the Chiefs took the lead as QB Matt Cassel got a 1-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe. The lead was cut in the third quarter with kicker Rian Lindell making a 43-yard field goal. The Chiefs scored with kicker Ryan Succop getting a 28-yard field goal. The Bills responded and tied the game with Ryan Fitzpatrick throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Steve Johnson. At overtime the decision was made with Succop successfully hitting a 35-yard field goal with 5 seconds left on the clock to win the game for the Chiefs.How many total yards did Ryan Succop kick for field goals?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Chiefs and the Bills. It seems like it's giving me a play-by-play of the scoring events during the game, and at the end, it's asking me to find out how many total yards Ryan Succop kicked for field goals. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the field goals that Ryan Succop made during the game. From the text, it looks like there are two mentions of him making field goals. Let's find those.\n\nThe first one is: \"The Chiefs scored with kicker Ryan Succop getting a 28-yard field goal.\" So, that's one field goal of 28 yards.\n\nThen, later in overtime, it says: \"At overtime the decision was made with Succop successfully hitting a 35-yard field goal with 5 seconds left on the clock to win the game for the Chiefs.\" So, that's another field goal, this time from 35 yards.\n\nNow, to find the total yards he kicked for field goals, I just need to add these two distances together. So, 28 yards plus 35 yards.\n\nLet me do that addition: 28 plus 35. 28 plus 30 is 58, and then plus 5 more is 63. So, total yards is 63.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that I didn't miss any other field goals by Succop. Let's scan the text again to make sure.\n\nThe text mentions another kicker, Rian Lindell, who made a 43-yard field goal for the Bills, but since he's not with the Chiefs, his field goals don't count towards Succop's total.\n\nAlso, there were touchdown passes mentioned, but again, those aren't field goals.\n\nSo, yes, only two field goals by Succop: 28 yards and 35 yards, totaling 63 yards.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other kicks that might be considered field goals. For example, was there any mention of extra points or anything like that? Extra points are different from field goals, so they don't count towards the field goal yardage.\n\nAlso, confirming the spellings: it's Ryan Succop, and the team is the Chiefs, playing against the Bills.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1930, St\u00e9nio Vincent, a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected President. By 1930, President Hoover had become concerned about the effects of the occupation, particularly after the December 1929 incident in Les Cayes. Hoover appointed a commission to study the situation, with William Cameron Forbes as the chair.:232-233 The Forbes Commission praised the material improvements that the U.S. administration had achieved, but it criticized the continued exclusion of Haitian nationals from positions of real authority in the government and the constabulary, which had come to be known as the Garde d'Ha\u00efti. In more general terms, the commission asserted that \"the social forces that created  still remain - poverty, ignorance, and the lack of a tradition or desire for orderly free government.\" The Hoover administration did not fully implement the recommendations of the Forbes Commission; but United States withdrawal was under way by 1932, when Hoover lost the presidency to Franklin D. Roosevelt. The latter as Assistant Secretary of the Navy had overall responsibility for drafting the most recent Haitian constitution; he was a proponent of the \"Good Neighbor policy\" for the US role in the Caribbean and Latin America. On a visit to Cap-Ha\u00eftien in July 1934, Roosevelt reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of U.S. Marines departed on August 15, 1934 after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde. The U.S. retained influence on Haiti's external finances until 1947.What was Roosevelt's job after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text here about Haiti and the United States' involvement there, particularly focusing on the period around 1930. It mentions St\u00e9nio Vincent being elected President in 1930, and then talks about President Hoover appointing a commission led by William Cameron Forbes to study the situation. The commission praised some improvements but criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority and noted ongoing social issues like poverty and lack of tradition for orderly government.\n\nThen, it says that by 1932, Hoover lost the presidency to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was a proponent of the \"Good Neighbor policy\" for U.S. relations with the Caribbean and Latin America. Roosevelt had previously been the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and was involved in drafting the most recent Haitian constitution.\n\nThe text mentions that Roosevelt visited Cap-Ha\u00eftien in July 1934 and reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last U.S. Marines left on August 15, 1934, after transferring authority to the Garde d'Ha\u00efti. The U.S. continued to influence Haiti's external finances until 1947.\n\nThe specific question is: \"What was Roosevelt's job after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy?\"\n\nFrom the text, it seems that Roosevelt was elected President in 1932, succeeding Hoover. So, after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy, which was likely during Woodrow Wilson's administration, he went on to become the President of the United States.\n\nTo confirm this, I recall that Franklin D. Roosevelt was indeed the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. He was Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 to 1920 under President Wilson.\n\nSo, after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt's next major job was running for public office again, eventually leading to his election as Governor of New York in 1928, and then as President in 1932.\n\nBut specifically, the text mentions that he was \"Assistant Secretary of the Navy\" and \"a proponent of the 'Good Neighbor policy'\". It then describes his visit to Haiti in 1934, which would be during his presidency.\n\nTherefore, the job after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy was President of the United States.\n\nWait a minute, but he was elected President in 1932, but before that, he was the Governor of New York from 1929 to 1932. So technically, after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he ran for public office again, was elected Governor of New York, and then President.\n\nBut the question is: \"What was Roosevelt's job after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy?\"\n\nThe direct answer should be: Governor of New York.\n\nBut to make sure, let's verify the timeline:\n\n- Assistant Secretary of the Navy: 1913-1920\n\n- Ran for Vice President in 1920 but lost\n\n- Elected Governor of New York in 1928\n\n- Re-elected in 1930\n\n- Elected President in 1932\n\n- Served as President from March 1933 until his death in 1945\n\nSo, after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy, his next job was Governor of New York.\n\nBut the text mentions him as \"Assistant Secretary of the Navy\" and then says \"he was a proponent of the 'Good Neighbor policy' for the U.S. role in the Caribbean and Latin America.\" The Good Neighbor policy is associated with his presidency.\n\nHowever, the specific question is about his job after being Assistant Secretary of the Navy, not about his policies.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be: Governor of New York.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps there were other positions he held between being Assistant Secretary of the Navy and being Governor.\n\nLooking it up, after resigning as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1920, Roosevelt ran for Vice President on the Democratic ticket, but they lost to the Republicans. After that, he returned to practicing law in New York City.\n\nIn 1920, Roosevelt was stricken with polio, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. He underwent therapy and treatment for his condition, including hydrotherapy at Warm Springs, Georgia, which he later purchased and turned into a rehabilitation center for polio patients.\n\nIn 1924, he made a dramatic appearance at the Democratic National Convention, helping to nominate Alfred E. Smith, who was then the Governor of New York.\n\nIn 1928, Smith, who was now the Democratic presidential nominee, asked Roosevelt to run for Governor of New York. Roosevelt won the\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:T. J. Yates started his second game of the season for the Texans due to Brian Hoyer being out with a concussion. Both teams were held scoreless in the 1st quarter, with the Colts striking first with Matt Hasselbeck connecting with Donte Moncrief for an 11-yard touchdown reception. With Adam Vinatieri making the extra point, Indianapolis lead 7-0 late in the 2nd quarter. The Colts scored again with Vinatieri making a 29-yard field goal, extending their lead to 10-0. The Texans managed to get on the board as the half wined down with a 22-yard field goal from Nick Novak. With Novak's field goal, Houston trailed 3-10 at the half. The Texans' defense held the Colts' offense to zero points in the 2nd half, while Houston's offense scored 13 unanswered points. The Texans made history by beating the Colts in Indianapolis for the first time in franchise history, winning 16-10. Third string quarterback Brandon Weeden helped the Texans past the Colts with an 8-yard pass to Jaelen Strong late in the 4th quarter. With the win, the Texans went to 7-7 and gained sole possession of the AFC South lead. Yates suffered an ACL tear during the game, ending his season.How many points did the colts score in the 2nd half?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this football game to analyze here. It's between the Texans and the Colts. T.J. Yates started for the Texans because Brian Hoyer was out with a concussion. Both teams didn't score in the first quarter, which happens sometimes. Then, in the second quarter, the Colts scored first with a touchdown pass from Matt Hasselbeck to Donte Moncrief, 11 yards. After that, Adam Vinatieri kicked the extra point, so Colts led 7-0.\n\nLater in the second quarter, the Colts scored again with a 29-yard field goal by Vinatieri, making it 10-0. The Texans finally got on the board just before halftime with a 22-yard field goal by Nick Novak, so at halftime, it was Colts 10, Texans 3.\n\nNow, the interesting part is that in the second half, the Colts' offense couldn't score at all, according to the text. So, no points for the Colts in the second half. Meanwhile, the Texans scored 13 unanswered points. So, starting from a 10-3 deficit at halftime, the Texans added 13 points, making it 16-10 in their favor.\n\nThere's also a mention of Brandon Weeden helping the Texans with an 8-yard pass to Jaelen Strong late in the fourth quarter, which probably contributed to those 13 points. And then, Yates got an ACL tear, ending his season.\n\nThe question is: How many points did the Colts score in the second half?\n\nWell, the text says that the Colts' offense was held scoreless in the second half by the Texans' defense. So, that means the Colts didn't score any points in the second half.\n\nTo confirm, at halftime, it was Colts 10, Texans 3. Final score is Texans 16, Colts 10. So, the Colts didn't add any points in the second half.\n\nTherefore, the answer is zero points.\n\nBut let's make sure. The Texans scored 13 unanswered points in the second half, which would mean they went from 3 to 16, while the Colts stayed at 10.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

Their estates were confiscated and their families relocated \u2014 Zrinski's wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in the Dominican convent in Graz where she fell mentally ill and remained until her death in 1673, two of his daughters died in a monastery, and his son Ivan Antun  died in madness, after twenty years of terrible imprisonment and torture, on 11 November 1703. The oldest daughter Jelena, already married in northeastern Upper Hungary, survived and continued the resistance. Some 2,000 other nobles were arrested as part of a mass crackdown.  Two more leading conspirators \u2014 Ferenc N\u00e1dasdy, Chief Justice of Hungary, and Styrian governor, Count Hans Erasmus von Tattenbach \u2014 were executed . In the view of Emperor Leopold, the Croats and Hungarians had forfeited their right to self-administration through their role in the attempted rebellion. Leopold suspended the constitution - already, the Zrinski trial had been conducted by an Austrian, not a Hungarian court - and ruled Hungary like a conquered province.How many daughters did Zrinski have?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about some historical events involving Zrinski and Frankopan. It's pretty detailed, but I need to focus on one specific question: how many daughters did Zrinski have?\n\nLet me read through the text carefully to find any mentions of Zrinski's daughters.\n\nFirst, it talks about Zrinski and Frankopan being executed in 1671. Then it mentions that their estates were confiscated and their families were relocated. Specifically for Zrinski's family, it says that his wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in a Dominican convent in Graz where she fell mentally ill and died in 1673.\n\nNext, it mentions \"two of his daughters died in a monastery.\" So that's an important point: two daughters died in a monastery.\n\nThen it says, \"his son Ivan Antun died in madness after twenty years of terrible imprisonment and torture, on 11 November 1703.\" So there's mention of at least one son.\n\nAfter that, it mentions \"the oldest daughter Jelena, already married in northeastern Upper Hungary, survived and continued the resistance.\" So there's another daughter named Jelena who survived.\n\nSo, let's tally up the daughters mentioned:\n\n1. Two daughters who died in a monastery.\n\n2. One daughter, Jelena, who survived.\n\nThat makes a total of three daughters.\n\nWait, but is there any other mention of daughters? Let's double-check the text to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThe text says: \"his wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in the Dominican convent in Graz where she fell mentally ill and remained until her death in 1673, two of his daughters died in a monastery, and his son Ivan Antun died in madness, after twenty years of terrible imprisonment and torture, on 11 November 1703. The oldest daughter Jelena, already married in northeastern Upper Hungary, survived and continued the resistance.\"\n\nSo, it's clear: two daughters died in the monastery, and one daughter, Jelena, survived. That's all the information given about his daughters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of daughters is three.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe there's more information elsewhere in the text about other family members.\n\nLooking back, there's mention of \"Some 2,000 other nobles were arrested as part of a mass crackdown.\" But that doesn't relate to Zrinski's family directly.\n\nAlso, it mentions the view of Emperor Leopold and some political consequences, but nothing more about Zrinski's family.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos' defense limited Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to 188 yards passing and no touchdowns, but their defensive effort was wasted by a poor performance from their inconsistent offense. The Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to a 45-yard field goal by Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. An interception off Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian by cornerback Logan Ryan resulted in the only touchdown of the game&#8212;a 1-yard run by Patriots' running back LeGarrette Blount in the second quarter. Gostkowski added two more field goals&#8212;a 40-yarder in the third quarter and a 21-yarder in the fourth. The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for this game.How many yards longer was Stephen Gostkowski's longest field goal compared to Brandon McManus' field goal?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Broncos and the Patriots. It seems like it's more about understanding the game's events and then answering a specific question about the field goals. The question is: \"How many yards longer was Stephen Gostkowski's longest field goal compared to Brandon McManus' field goal?\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the field goals made by each kicker and their respective yardages.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n- The Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus made a 33-yard field goal.\n\n- The Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski made field goals of 45 yards, 40 yards, and 21 yards.\n\nSo, Brandon McManus: 33 yards.\n\nStephen Gostkowski: 45, 40, and 21 yards.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference between Gostkowski's longest field goal and McManus' field goal.\n\nFirst, I need to determine Gostkowski's longest field goal. Looking at his field goals, he made kicks of 45, 40, and 21 yards. The longest among these is 45 yards.\n\nMcManus' field goal is 33 yards.\n\nSo, the difference is 45 yards minus 33 yards.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n45 - 33 = 12 yards.\n\nTherefore, Gostkowski's longest field goal was 12 yards longer than McManus' field goal.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check if there are any other field goals or if I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the text:\n\n- First quarter: Gostkowski's 45-yard field goal.\n\n- Third quarter: Gostkowski's 40-yard field goal.\n\n- Fourth quarter: Gostkowski's 21-yard field goal.\n\n- McManus' 33-yard field goal is mentioned separately.\n\nYes, that's all the field goals mentioned.\n\nSo, the longest for Gostkowski is indeed 45 yards.\n\nMcManus had only one field goal, which was 33 yards.\n\nDifference is 45 - 33 = 12 yards.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's something else in the text I need to consider.\n\nThe text mentions the game events:\n\n- Fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to Gostkowski's 45-yard field goal.\n\n- Interception off Trevor Siemian led to LeGarrette Blount's 1-yard touchdown run.\n\n- Gostkowski's other field goals were from 40 and 21 yards.\n\n- Broncos scored only a 33-yard field goal by McManus.\n\nNo other field goals are mentioned, so my initial assessment is correct.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

The events began with a coup by the Persian Cossack Brigade headed by Reza Khan, and directed by the British, on 21 February 1921. With this coup Zia'eddin Tabatabaee took over power and became Prime Minister. The coup was largely bloodless and faced little resistance. With his expanded forces and the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan launched successful military actions to eliminate separatist and dissident movements in Tabriz, Mashhad and the Janglis in Gilan.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In April 1400, Li Jinglong mobilised 600,000 men and began advancing northwards toward the Baigou River. On 24 April, the Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle.The government forces ambushed Zhu Di, and the Yan forces suffered a series of defeat initially. Landmines were placed in the retreat path of the Yan forces by the government forces, which inflicted heavy losses for the Yan Army on their way back to the camp.A new battle ensued the following day, and the government forces were successful in attacking the rear of the Yan forces. Zhu Di led a personal charge against the main force of Li Jinglong, and the battle turned into a stalemate as Zhu Gaochi arrived with reinforcements.At this point, the wind started to blow and snapped the flag of Li Jinglong in half, which led to chaos in the government camp. Zhu Di seized the opportunity and launched a general assault and defeated the government forces. More than 100,000 government troops surrendered to the Yan forces, and Li Jinglong retreated back to Dezhou once again. On 27 April, the Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou to siege the city. The Yan forces captured Dezhou on 9 May, and Li Jinglong was forced to flee to Jinan. The Yan forces followed up immediately and encircled the city of Jinan on 15 May, and Li Jinglong fled back to Nanjing. Despite of losing the entire army and being condemned by the imperial court, Li Jinglong was spared of execution.How many days after the Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle did the Yan forces capture Dezhou?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a timeline of events here, and we need to figure out how many days passed between the decisive battle and the capture of Dezhou by the Yan forces.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key dates mentioned in the text:\n\n1. **24 April:** The Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle.\n\n2. **27 April:** The Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou to siege the city.\n\n3. **9 May:** The Yan forces captured Dezhou.\n\nOur goal is to find out how many days elapsed between the decisive battle on 24 April and the capture of Dezhou on 9 May.\n\nTo calculate the number of days between these two dates, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days remaining in April after the battle:**\n\n   - The battle was on 24 April.\n\n   - April has 30 days.\n\n   - So, the number of days remaining in April after the battle is \\(30 - 24 = 6\\) days.\n\n2. **Add the days in May up to the capture of Dezhou:**\n\n   - Dezhou was captured on 9 May.\n\n   - Therefore, the number of days in May up to that date is 9 days.\n\n3. **Sum the days from step 1 and step 2:**\n\n   - Days remaining in April: 6 days\n\n   - Days in May up to 9 May: 9 days\n\n   - Total days: \\(6 + 9 = 15\\) days\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this calculation to make sure we're not missing anything.\n\n- The battle was on 24 April.\n\n- From 24 April to 30 April is 7 days (including both 24 and 30 April).\n\n- Then, from 1 May to 9 May is 9 days.\n\n- So, total days would be \\(7 + 9 = 16\\) days.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. In my initial calculation, I subtracted 24 from 30 to get 6 days, but that doesn't include the day of the battle itself. So, if the battle was on 24 April, that day should be included in the count until the capture on 9 May.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Calculate the total number of days from 24 April to 9 May.\n\n- April has 30 days, so from 24 April to 30 April is \\(30 - 24 + 1 = 7\\) days (including both 24 and 30 April).\n\n- Then, from 1 May to 9 May is 9 days.\n\n- Therefore, total days: \\(7 + 9 = 16\\) days.\n\nBut the text mentions that the Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou on 27 April, and captured it on 9 May. So, perhaps there's a need to consider the marching period.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of days after the decisive battle on 24 April until the capture of Dezhou on 9 May.\n\nSo, from 24 April to 9 May is indeed 16 days.\n\nBut in the initial calculation, I got 15 days, which seems incorrect now.\n\nLet me verify again:\n\n- 24 April: battle\n\n- 25 April: day 1 after battle\n\n- 26 April: day 2\n\n- 27 April: day 3, began marching\n\n- 28 April: day 4\n\n- 29 April: day 5\n\n- 30 April: day 6\n\n- 1 May: day 7\n\n- 2 May: day 8\n\n- 3 May: day 9\n\n- 4 May: day 10\n\n- 5 May: day 11\n\n- 6 May: day 12\n\n- 7 May: day 13\n\n- 8 May: day 14\n\n- 9 May: day 15\n\nWait, counting like this, from 24 April to 9 May is 16 days, but if we exclude the day of the battle, it's 15 days.\n\nBut the battle occurred on 24 April, and the capture was on 9 May, so the period between them is 15 days.\n\nHowever, in terms of elapsed time from the start of the battle to the capture, it's 16 days.\n\nI think the correct approach is to include both the starting and ending dates if the events occurred on those days.\n\nBut in this context, probably, the battle started on 24 April and the capture was on 9 May\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:At the 2011 census, there were 1,729,040 people with 906,782 households living in Budapest. Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapests boundaries during work hours, and during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events. By ethnicity there were 1,397,851 (80.8%) Hungarians, 19,530 (1.1%) Romani people, 18,278 (1.0%) Germans, 6,189 (0.4%) Romanians, 4,692 (0.3%) Han Chinese and 2,581 (0.1%) Slovaks. 301,943 people (17.5%) did not declare their ethnicity. In Hungary people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population. The city is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.How many  more percent were Hungarians than Romanians at the 2011 census?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here from the 2011 census data for Budapest. It gives the population and some ethnic breakdowns, and I need to find out how many more percent Hungarians were compared to Romanians at that time.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. I need to find the percentage difference between the proportion of Hungarians and the proportion of Romanians in Budapest's population in 2011.\n\nFrom the text, here are the relevant figures:\n\n- Total population of Budapest: 1,729,040 people\n\n- Hungarians: 1,397,851 (80.8%)\n\n- Romanians: 6,189 (0.4%)\n\nWait a minute, the text says that people can declare more than one ethnicity, which means the sum of ethnicities can be higher than the total population. However, for the purpose of calculating percentages of the total population, I should use the total population figure provided.\n\nSo, the percentage of Hungarians is already given as 80.8%, and for Romanians, it's 0.4%. To find out how many more percent Hungarians there were than Romanians, I can simply subtract the percentage of Romanians from the percentage of Hungarians.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPercentage difference = Percentage of Hungarians - Percentage of Romanians\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPercentage difference = 80.8% - 0.4% = 80.4%\n\nSo, Hungarians were 80.4% more than Romanians in Budapest in 2011.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if this is the correct way to interpret \"how many more percent.\" Sometimes, percentage difference can be calculated differently, especially when comparing two quantities.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the difference in the number of Hungarians and Romanians, then find what percentage that difference is relative to the total population.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nDifference in number = Number of Hungarians - Number of Romanians\n\n= 1,397,851 - 6,189 = 1,391,662\n\nNow, to find this difference as a percentage of the total population:\n\nPercentage difference = (Difference in number / Total population) * 100\n\n= (1,391,662 / 1,729,040) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, divide 1,391,662 by 1,729,040:\n\n1,391,662 \u00f7 1,729,040 \u2248 0.804\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.804 * 100 = 80.4%\n\nSo, again, I get 80.4%.\n\nIt seems like both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I can confidently say that there were 80.4% more Hungarians than Romanians in Budapest in 2011, relative to the total population.\n\nWait a second, is that the correct interpretation? Let me make sure.\n\nActually, the question is \"how many more percent were Hungarians than Romanians.\" This is asking for the difference in their percentages.\n\nSince Hungarians make up 80.8% and Romanians make up 0.4%, the difference is indeed 80.4 percentage points.\n\nHowever, sometimes \"percentage difference\" can be interpreted differently, especially in terms of relative difference.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was asking by what factor Hungarians outnumbered Romanians, that would be different.\n\nBut in this case, it's clearly asking for the difference in their percentages, which is 80.4 percentage points.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling New Azerbaijan Party strengthened its grasp on the legislature, securing a majority of 73 out of 125 seats. The other seats went to nominally independent, government-leaning candidates, and to \"soft opposition\" parties. The two major opposition parties  lost their previous eight seats, thus resulting in an opposition-free Parliament. The Central Election Commission said turnout was 50.1%, out of a total 4.9 million people eligible to vote. Opposition leaders suggested the low turnout was due to candidate disqualifications by the CEC, and consequent discouragements to vote after their choice of candidate was excluded. The United States declared that the elections \"did not meet international standards\", while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, EU and Council of Europe highlighted some positive aspects, while stating that \"the conduct of the elections did not represent significant progress in the process of the country's democratic development\". 2015 Parliamentary elections resulted in 72 seats won by ruling party. Currently Parliament consists of 15 parliamentary committees:How many seats did the New Azerbaijan Party not secure in the 2010 parliamentary elections?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about some parliamentary elections in 2010. It says that the New Azerbaijan Party secured a majority of 73 out of 125 seats. I need to find out how many seats they didn't secure in those elections.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 125 seats in total in the legislature. The New Azerbaijan Party got 73 of those seats. So, to find out how many seats they didn't secure, I should subtract the number of seats they got from the total number of seats.\n\nSo, that would be 125 minus 73. Let me do that calculation.\n\n125 - 73 = 52\n\nSo, the New Azerbaijan Party didn't secure 52 seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly, let's look back at the text. It says that the other seats went to nominally independent, government-leaning candidates, and to \"soft opposition\" parties. So, those 52 seats are divided among these other groups.\n\nThe text also mentions that the two major opposition parties lost their previous eight seats, resulting in an opposition-free Parliament. But since there are \"soft opposition\" parties getting some seats, it seems like there is still some opposition representation, just not from the major opposition parties.\n\nAlso, the text provides some context about the election process, turnout, and international reactions, but that doesn't directly relate to the question at hand.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

Afterwards, Manning and Addai hooked up with each other on a 19-yard TD pass, while rookie CB Michael Coe blocked a punt, causing it go through the back of Baltimore's end zone for a safety. In the second quarter, Addai made an 11-yard TD run. The Ravens immediately responded as WR Yamon Figurs returned a kickoff 94&#160;yards for a touchdown, yet Indianapolis continued its run with Manning completing a 57-yard TD pass to rookie WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, the Colts put the game away with Manning finding Gonzalez again on a 40-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried a feeble comeback as QB Kyle Boller completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling, while QB Troy Smith got a 6-yard TD run. With the win, not only did Indianapolis improve to 11-2, but they also clinched their 6th-straight playoff berth. Peyton Manning even had a record night.

At game's end, he ended up with 302 touchdown passes, surpassing John Elway for 4th place on the All-Time TD passes list.Which quarter did Joseph Addai have the most TD's?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this game summary to read about the Colts playing against the Baltimore Ravens. It's from Week 14, and it's a Sunday night game. It's a rematch of the previous year's AFC Divisional game. The Colts had just come off a season-sweep over the Jaguars, so they were probably feeling pretty good.\n\nAlright, let's dive into the game details. In the first quarter, the Colts scored first with Peyton Manning throwing a 34-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Then, Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run. After that, Manning and Addai connected again on a 19-yard TD pass. Oh, and there's something about a safety: rookie CB Michael Coe blocked a punt that went through the back of Baltimore's end zone.\n\nMoving on to the second quarter, Addai had another TD, this time an 11-yard run. The Ravens responded quickly with Yamon Figurs returning a kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. But the Colts kept rolling with Manning throwing a 57-yard TD pass to rookie WR Anthony Gonzalez.\n\nIn the third quarter, it was more of the same as Manning found Gonzalez again for a 40-yard TD pass, and that was the only score of the period.\n\nFourth quarter saw a feeble comeback from the Ravens. Kyle Boller threw a 4-yard TD pass to Devard Darling, and QB Troy Smith ran for a 6-yard TD. But it was too little, too late.\n\nThe Colts won the game, improving to 11-2 and clinching their sixth straight playoff berth. Peyton Manning reached a milestone by becoming the fifth player in NFL history to throw 300 career TD passes, ending the game with 302, surpassing John Elway for fourth place on the all-time TD passes list.\n\nNow, the specific question is: Which quarter did Joseph Addai have the most TDs?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst quarter: Addai had a 1-yard TD run and then a 19-yard TD pass from Manning.

Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers for net polished diamond exports for both years. Looking at the text, I see that in 2012, net polished diamond exports were $5.56 billion, and in 2011, they were $7.2 billion. So, right there, it looks like 2011 had higher exports.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm looking at the right figures. The text says, \"Israels net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.\" Okay, so it explicitly states that exports fell from $7.2 billion in 2011 to $5.56 billion in 2012. So, 2011 had higher exports.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there's any other information that might contradict this or if I'm misreading something. The text also mentions net exports of rough diamonds dropping to $2.8 billion in 2012 from an implied higher amount in 2011, and net rough diamond imports dropping to $3.8 billion. But for polished diamonds, it's clear: $7.2 billion in 2011 and $5.56 billion in 2012.\n\nAlso, it mentions that the decline is due to the global financial crisis, especially in Europe and the US, which are major markets for Israeli diamonds. The US is the largest market with 36% of exports, followed by Hong Kong at 28%, and Belgium at 8%.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In week 15, the Lions traveled west for an interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders struck first when Louis Murphy ran in a touchdown from 12 yards out. The Lions responded with a 51-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson. In the second quarter, Oakland re-took the lead when Darrius Heyward-Bey caught a 43-yard pass from Carson Palmer, but the Lions tied it back up when Nate Burlseon caught a 39-yard pass for a TD. Oakland took the lead back just before halftime with a 46-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After a scoreless third quarter, the Raiders kicked a 51-yard field goal, and added 7 more points when Aaron Curry picked up a Matthew Stafford fumble and ran it in 6 yards for a touchdown, putting them up 27-14 with just under 8 minutes left in the game. The Lions then mounted their 6th comeback of the season from a 13+ point deficit, first with a 3-yard catch by Titus Young, then Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 6 yards out to put them up 28-27 with 39 seconds left to play. The Raiders then drove down the field, and attempted a 65-yard field goal on fourth down, which would have broken Sebastian Janikowski's own NFL-record of 63 yards which he shares with two other placekickers, but it was blocked by Ndamukong Suh, giving the Lions the win and keeping their playoff hopes alive as the team improved to 9-5, securing their first winning season since 2000.How many catches did Titus Young have?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question here about a football game between the Lions and the Raiders in week 15. It's kind of long, but I need to find out how many catches Titus Young had in that game. Let me read through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, it says the Raiders scored first with a 12-yard touchdown run by Louis Murphy. Then, the Lions responded with a 51-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson. So, that's one touchdown for Calvin Johnson.\n\nMoving on, in the second quarter, the Raiders scored again with a 43-yard pass from Carson Palmer to Darrius Heyward-Bey. Then, the Lions tied it up with a 39-yard pass to Nate Burleson. So, another touchdown pass for the Lions.\n\nAfter that, the Raiders kicked a 46-yard field goal just before halftime, making the score 14-10 in favor of the Raiders.\n\nThen, it says there were no scores in the third quarter, so the score remained 14-10 Raiders going into the fourth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Raiders kicked a 51-yard field goal, making it 17-14 Raiders. Then, they added another 7 points when Aaron Curry picked up a Matthew Stafford fumble and ran it in for a touchdown, making it 24-14.\n\nWait, but earlier it said they kicked a 51-yard field goal, making it 17-14, and then added 7 more points for a touchdown, making it 24-14. But the text says they kicked a 51-yard field goal and then added 7 more points to make it 27-14. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let's check.\n\nIt says: \"Oakland took the lead back just before halftime with a 46-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski.\" That would make it 17-10, actually. Wait, no, earlier scores were:\n\nRaiders: 7 (Louis Murphy TD)\n\nLions: 7 (Johnson TD)\n\nRaiders: 7 (Heyward-Bey TD) - total 14\n\nLions: 7 (Burleson TD) - total 14\n\nRaiders: 3 (field goal) - total 17\n\nSo, halftime was 17-14 Raiders.\n\nThen, in the fourth quarter, they kicked another 51-yard field goal, making it 20-14.\n\nThen, Aaron Curry's touchdown return made it 27-14.\n\nWait, but the text says they kicked a 51-yard field goal and then added 7 more points to make it 27-14. So, 17-14 at halftime, then a 51-yard field goal in the fourth, which would be 20-14, and then the touchdown makes it 27-14.\n\nBut the text says \"putting them up 27-14 with just under 8 minutes left in the game.\" Okay, that makes sense.\n\nThen, the Lions mounted their sixth comeback from a 13+ point deficit. First, they scored a 3-yard catch by Titus Young. So, that's a touchdown, right? Assuming it's a touchdown, that would make it 27-21.\n\nThen, Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 6 yards out, making it 28-27 in favor of the Lions with 39 seconds left.\n\nFinally, the Raiders tried a 65-yard field goal, which was blocked by Ndamukong Suh, securing the win for the Lions.\n\nSo, the final score is 28-27, Lions.\n\nNow, the question is: how many catches did Titus Young have?\n\nLooking back at the text, I only see one mention of Titus Young: \"the Lions then mounted their 6th comeback of the season from a 13+ point deficit, first with a 3-yard catch by Titus Young, then Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 6 yards out to put them up 28-27 with 39 seconds left to play.\"\n\nSo, it only mentions one catch by Titus Young. Therefore, the answer should be one.\n\nBut wait, maybe there were multiple catches by Titus Young, and it's only mentioning the one that was a touchdown. Maybe he had other receptions earlier in the game that weren't mentioned.\n\nHmm, the text only specifies the key plays that led to the comeback. It's possible that Titus Young had other catches that aren't mentioned in this summary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is only highlighting the important plays and not\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:A second expedition had to be conducted to bring Lan Na under control again. The Siamese army invaded Chiang Mai, catching the Burmese command completely off guard. The Siamese captured Chiang Mai on 10 February 1663, and drove back Burmese forces that arrived belatedly at Sai Yok. In November 1663, the Siamese then led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then laid siege to Pagan in 1664. Burmese defences withstood several Siamese onslaughts until May 1664 before the rainy season arrived, after \"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\", the Siamese retreated.:220-239 Meanwhile, the Siamese garrison at Chiang Mai was holed up in a deserted city, and its troops were constantly ambushed by resistance forces whenever they ventured out of the city. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai, and returned.What did the Siamese capture last: Pegu or Chiang Mai?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about some historical events involving the Siamese army and their expeditions. The question is asking what the Siamese captured last: Pegu or Chiang Mai? Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the captures mentioned in the text and note the order in which they happened.\n\nLooking at the text, it says: \"The Siamese captured Chiang Mai on 10 February 1663, and drove back Burmese forces that arrived belatedly at Sai Yok.\"\n\nSo, Chiang Mai was captured on 10 February 1663.\n\nThen, in November 1663, \"the Siamese then led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then laid siege to Pagan in 1664.\"\n\nOkay, so in this invasion, they captured several places: Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then besieged Pagan in 1664.\n\nThe siege of Pagan started in 1664, and it says that the Burmese defenses withstood several Siamese onslaughts until May 1664 before the rainy season arrived. Then, after causing many casualties and capturing prisoners, the Siamese retreated.\n\nAfter that, it mentions that the Siamese garrison at Chiang Mai was holed up in a deserted city and their troops were constantly ambushed by resistance forces. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai and returned.\n\nSo, the sequence of events is:\n\n1. Chiang Mai captured in February 1663.\n\n2. Invasion of Burma in November 1663, capturing Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and besieging Pagan in 1664.\n\n3. Siege of Pagan from some point in 1664 until May 1664.\n\n4. Siamese retreat after May 1664.\n\n5. Evacuation of Chiang Mai in late November 1664.\n\nNow, the question is asking what was captured last: Pegu or Chiang Mai.\n\nFrom the sequence above:\n\n- Chiang Mai was captured in February 1663.\n\n- Pegu was captured during the invasion in November 1663.\n\nSo, Pegu was captured after Chiang Mai.\n\nBut wait, the Siamese also evacuated Chiang Mai in late November 1664, which is after they had captured Pegu in November 1663.\n\nHowever, the question is about what was captured last, not what was held last.\n\nCapturing and evacuating are two different actions.\n\nSo, capturing-wise, Pegu was captured in November 1663, and Chiang Mai was captured in February 1663, but evacuated in late November 1664.\n\nTherefore, capturing-wise, Pegu was captured after Chiang Mai.\n\nBut, if we consider the evacuation as a loss of control, perhaps that's not relevant to the capture timeline.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the evacuation indicates that Chiang Mai was no longer under Siamese control, but the question is about captures, not control.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"What did the Siamese capture last: Pegu or Chiang Mai?\"\n\nSo, it's asking which one was captured later in time.\n\nChiang Mai: February 1663\n\nPegu: November 1663\n\nTherefore, Pegu was captured after Chiang Mai.\n\nHence, Pegu was captured last.\n\nWait, but the Siamese also evacuated Chiang Mai in November 1664, which is after Pegu was captured in November 1663.\n\nBut the evacuation is not a capture; it's the opposite.\n\nSo, the last capture was Pegu in November 1663.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there's something else in the text that indicates another capture after Pegu.\n\nLet's check again.\n\nIt says they captured Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then laid siege to Pagan in 1664.\n\nSiege of Pagan started in 1664, but it doesn't say they captured Pagan. It says they besieged it, had several assaults, caused casualties, captured prisoners, but then retreated when the rainy season arrived.\n\nSo, they didn't capture Pagan; they just besieged it.\n\nTherefore, the last place they actually captured was Pegu in November \n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

At the end, it says that the Seahawks won the game and improved their record to 6-6, which was better than their record in the previous two seasons.\n\nThe question is asking, \"How many points did the Seahawks improve by?\" Now, this seems a bit confusing because usually, when we talk about improving a record, we think in terms of wins and losses, not points. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what \"improved by\" means in this context. If they improved their record to 6-6, that means they had fewer wins in the previous seasons. The text says they \"surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons,\" so in those seasons, they must have had fewer than 6 wins.\n\nLet's assume that in each of the last two seasons, they had fewer than 6 wins. But to find out exactly how many points they improved by, I need to know what their win-loss record was in the previous seasons.\n\nWait, but the question is about points, not wins. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be \"how many games did the Seahawks improve by?\" Because improving by points doesn't make much sense in this context. Football games are won based on points, but records are based on wins and losses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the point differential in the game, but that doesn't align with the statement about surpassing their victory mark.\n\nLet me read the text again carefully:\n\n\"the Seahawks improved to 6-6, they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.\"\n\nThis suggests that in the last two seasons, their win total was less than 6. So, if they are now 6-6, that's 6 wins. Suppose in each of the last two seasons, they had, say, 5 wins. Then, they improved by 1 win compared to each of those seasons.\n\nBut the question says \"points,\" which is confusing. Maybe it's asking for the point spread in the game against the Panthers, but that doesn't seem related to improving their record.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the total points scored in the game, but again, that doesn't connect to improving their record.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe it's asking for the final score difference between the Seahawks and the Panthers in this game, and that's what \"improve by\" refers to.\n\nLet me try to find out the total points each team scored based on the text.\n\nIt says:\n\n- Panthers scored first with a 6-yard TD run by Mike Goodson. A touchdown is worth 6 points, plus probably an extra point, so 7 points.\n\n- Then, Jonathan Stewart got a 3-yard TD run, another 7 points for the Panthers.\n\n- Then, Olindo Mare kicked a 24-yard field goal for the Panthers, which is 3 points.\n\n- So, total for the Panthers: 7 + 7 + 3 = 17 points.\n\nNow, for the Seahawks:\n\n- Marshawn Lynch got a 1-yard TD run, which is 6 points plus extra point makes 7.\n\n- Then, Lofa Tatupu returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown, another 7 points.\n\n- Finally, Lynch got two more TD runs: one for 1 yard and one for 22 yards, that's two more touchdowns, so 14 points.\n\n- Assuming they made extra points each time, that's 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 points in total for the Seahawks.\n\nSo, the final score was Seahawks 28, Panthers 17.\n\nThe Seahawks won by 28 - 17 = 11 points.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many points they improved by, which doesn't directly relate to the point difference in this game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the fact that they won this game, which contributed to their win total, and is worth 1 win, which in terms of points in the standings is 1 point.\n\nWait, in sports standings, each win usually counts as 1 point. So, if they had, say, 5 wins in the previous seasons, and now they have 6 wins, they improved by 1 win, which is 1 point in the standings.\n\nBut the text says they \"improved to 6-6,\" meaning they have 6 wins and 6 losses. It doesn't specify what their record was in the previous seasons, but it says they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:As of the census of 2010, there were 520,116 people, 229,762 households, and 112,455 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,500.1 inhabitants per square mile (965.3/km\u00b2). There were 209,609 housing units at an average density of 1,076.7 per square mile (415.7/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 69.7% White (down from 94.8% in 1970), 5.0% Black or African-American, 2.7% Native American, 2.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 16.9% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 41.6% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 47.2% of the population in 2010, down from 72.8% in 1970.How many percent were not from 2 or more races?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this census data from 2010 for a city, and it gives a bunch of demographic information. The question is asking for the percentage of people who are not from two or more races. From the text, I can see that 3.8% of the population is from two or more races. So, to find the percentage that's not from two or more races, I think I just need to subtract that 3.8% from 100%.\n\nLet me double-check the text to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. It says: \"69.7% White, 5.0% Black or African-American, 2.7% Native American, 2.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 16.9% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races.\" And then it mentions that Hispanic or Latino of any race were 41.6% of the population, and non-Hispanic whites were 47.2%.\n\nI need to find the percentage not from two or more races. So, total population is 100%, and 3.8% are from two or more races. Therefore, 100% - 3.8% should give me the percentage from only one race.\n\nBut wait, I think it's a bit more complicated because the categories might overlap, especially with the Hispanic or Latino category, which can be of any race. But for the purpose of this question, since it's specifically about race categories, and the \"two or more races\" category is separate, I think subtracting 3.8% from 100% should give me the right answer.\n\nLet me verify this approach. If 3.8% are from two or more races, then the remaining percentage should be from one race only. So, 100% - 3.8% = 96.2%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's add up all the percentages given for the individual races and see if they add up to 100%.\n\nWhite: 69.7%\n\nBlack or African-American: 5.0%\n\nNative American: 2.7%\n\nAsian: 2.9%\n\nPacific Islander: 0.2%\n\nFrom other races: 16.9%\n\nTwo or more races: 3.8%\n\nAdding these up: 69.7 + 5.0 = 74.7; 74.7 + 2.7 = 77.4; 77.4 + 2.9 = 80.3; 80.3 + 0.2 = 80.5; 80.5 + 16.9 = 97.4; 97.4 + 3.8 = 101.2%.\n\nHmm, that's odd. The total is 101.2%, which is over 100%. Maybe there's an overlap or something I'm missing. Perhaps the Hispanic or Latino category is being counted separately and not exclusively.\n\nThe text says \"Hispanic or Latino of any race were 41.6% of the population.\" So, Hispanic or Latino can be of any race, meaning they are included in the race percentages as well. That might be why the total is over 100%.\n\nFor example, someone who is Hispanic and White would be counted in both the White category and the Hispanic category.\n\nGiven that, the total percentage can exceed 100% because some people are being counted in more than one category.\n\nSo, in that case, the \"two or more races\" category likely doesn't include people who are Hispanic and of one race, but people who identify as multiple races.\n\nTherefore, to find the percentage not from two or more races, I should still just subtract the 3.8% from 100%, which gives me 96.2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some people who are Hispanic and of one race might be considered as being from two \"categories\" (race and ethnicity), but based on the way the question is phrased, it seems like it's only referring to race categories.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 96.2%.\n\nWait, but the question is \"how many percent were not from two or more races?\" and according to the data, it's 100% - 3.8% = 96.2%.\n\nBut I recall that in census data, sometimes there are people who didn't provide information or were not counted, but in this case, the total is 101.2%, which suggests some overlap or error in the way the data is presented.\n\nAlternatively\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After coming off of the embarrassing and aggravating loss to the Packers the week before, the Cowboys managed to hold the Redskins to only two field goals to lead 14-6 at halftime. In the third quarter, Kirk Cousins threw two touchdown passes to give the Redskins a 20-14 lead at the end of the 3rd. The Cowboys, in an attempt to not repeat the mistakes of the previous week, sent Dan Bailey out to kick a field goal to trail 17-20 early in the 4th. The Redskins extended their lead to 23-17 after another field goal. At the 3:29 mark, the Cowboys went back to work to start at their own 13 yard line. Romo led the Cowboys downfield thanks in large part to a Terrance Williams 51 yard catch and then a Dez Bryant catch and run for 17 yards to set up first and goal at the Redskins' 4 yard line. DeMarco Murray carried the ball for all three plays (+3, no gain, -9). Facing 4th and goal at the Washington 10 yard line,  Tony Romo climbed the pocket and fired a pass to DeMarco Murray in the end zone to tie the game 23-23. With the extra point good, the Cowboys led 24-23 with 1:01 remaining in the game. Washington started their drive on their own 13 yard line after a 10-yard illegal block penalty negated what would have been a 21-yard return (to the WAS 23). Kirk Cousins and co. could not sustain their drive, totaling 4 yards on four passing attempts. The Redskins turned the ball over on downs with 40 seconds remaining in the game. Lining up in the victory formation, Tony Romo was able to kneel the ball down and run the clock out. With the win, the Cowboys advanced to 5-0 in the NFC East and kept their playoff hopes alive to set up a do-or-die at home versus the Eagles. Romo was seen limping through most of the fourth quarter after rolling out of what would have been a sack by Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson. The Cowboys later confirmed injury reports of Romo suffering a herniated disc in his lower back. Despite statements that he will be ready to face Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles for the NFC East Championship, Romo was placed on Injured Reserve. The Cowboys tried to delay surgery by administering an epidural injection two days prior to the anticipated game, but it was decided Romo needed the surgery and ended his season.What did they do to try and delay surgery for Romo?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about a football game between the Cowboys and the Redskins. It sounds like it was a pretty intense game, especially since the Cowboys were coming off a loss and were trying to keep their playoff hopes alive. Let me try to understand what happened in this game step by step.\n\nFirst, the Cowboys managed to hold the Redskins to only two field goals in the first half, leading 14-6 at halftime. That's a good position to be in. Then, in the third quarter, the Redskins' quarterback, Kirk Cousins, threw two touchdown passes, which tied or maybe even took the lead. So, at the end of the third quarter, the Redskins were leading 20-14.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Cowboys kicked another field goal to make it 17-20. The Redskins added another field goal to make it 23-17. So, with about 3 minutes left in the game, the Cowboys had the ball at their own 13-yard line.\n\nThey started driving down the field, and there were some big plays: Terrance Williams caught a 51-yard pass, and Dez Bryant had a 17-yard catch and run. That set them up at the Redskins' 4-yard line, which is a great position to score a touchdown.\n\nThen, DeMarco Murray had three carries: +3 yards, no gain, and then -9 yards. So, that's not good. They were at the 4-yard line, then after three plays, they were at the 10-yard line, facing 4th and goal.\n\nTony Romo threw a pass to DeMarco Murray in the end zone, and it was caught, tying the game at 23-23. After a successful extra point, the Cowboys led 24-23 with about a minute left.\n\nThe Redskins got the ball back at their own 13-yard line, but due to an illegal block penalty, their return started at their own 13 instead of potentially at the 23. They couldn't move the ball and had to turn it over on downs with 40 seconds left.\n\nThe Cowboys then ran out the clock by kneeling the ball. So, it looks like they won the game 24-23.\n\nBut then, there's some information about Tony Romo getting injured. It says he was limping in the fourth quarter after rolling out of a potential sack. He was diagnosed with a herniated disc in his lower back.\n\nInitially, there were statements that he might be able to play in the next game against the Eagles for the NFC East Championship, but eventually, he was placed on Injured Reserve, meaning he wouldn't play again that season.\n\nBefore the game against the Eagles, the Cowboys tried to delay surgery for Romo by giving him an epidural injection two days prior to the game. But ultimately, it was decided that he needed surgery, which ended his season.\n\nSo, the question is: What did they do to try and delay surgery for Romo?\n\nFrom the text, it says that the Cowboys administered an epidural injection two days prior to the anticipated game to delay surgery. So, they gave Romo an epidural injection to manage his pain and see if his condition would improve without immediate surgery.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their win over the Bengals, the Steelers stayed at home for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the New York Jets.  Pittsburgh immediately trailed in the first quarter with Jets wide receiver/quarterback Brad Smith returning the game's opening kickoff 97&#160;yards for a touchdown.  The Steelers answered in the second quarter with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger finding tight end Matt Spaeth on a 9-yard touchdown.  New York struck back with kicker Nick Folk making a 25-yard field goal, yet Pittsburgh tied the game with a 42-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham. The Steelers took the lead in the third quarter with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Rashard Mendenhall, but the Jets replied with quarterback Mark Sanchez getting a 7-yard touchdown run.  New York took back their lead in the fourth quarter with Folk booting a 34-yard field goal, followed by linebacker Jason Taylor tackling running back Mewelde Moore in the endzone for a safety.  Pittsburgh tried to rally, but the Jets defense would hold on to preserve the win.Which player scored the first points of the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this question about a football game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets. It's from Week 15, and it looks like it was an intraconference duel, meaning they were in the same conference. The Steelers had just come off a win against the Bengals, so they were probably feeling pretty good heading into this game.\n\nThe text says they stayed at home for this game, which is against the New York Jets. Let's see what happened in the game.\n\nFirst off, it mentions that the Jets' wide receiver/quarterback Brad Smith returned the game's opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. So, right from the start, the Jets scored a touchdown on the kickoff. That's got to be a huge momentum booster for them, starting the game with 7 points.\n\nThen, the Steelers responded in the second quarter. Their quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, found tight end Matt Spaeth on a 9-yard touchdown pass. So, Pittsburgh scored a touchdown to tie the game, I assume, since the kickoff return was worth 7 points, and this was likely a touchdown pass, also worth 7 points.\n\nAfter that, the Jets' kicker, Nick Folk, made a 25-yard field goal. So, the Jets went up by 3 points again. But then, the Steelers' kicker, Shaun Suisham, kicked a 42-yard field goal to tie the game again.\n\nMoving to the third quarter, the Steelers took the lead with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Rashard Mendenhall. So, Pittsburgh was up by 7 points at that point.\n\nBut the Jets didn't back down; their quarterback, Mark Sanchez, got a 7-yard touchdown run of his own. So, it looks like the game was seesawing back and forth, with neither team able to gain a significant lead.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Jets' kicker, Nick Folk, made another field goal, this time from 34 yards out. So, they probably took the lead again at that point.\n\nThen, there was a safety when Jets linebacker Jason Taylor tackled Steelers running back Mewelde Moore in the endzone. Safeties are worth 2 points, so that would have added to the Jets' lead.\n\nThe Steelers tried to rally, but the Jets' defense held on to preserve the win.\n\nNow, the specific question is: Which player scored the first points of the game?\n\nFrom the description, it sounds like the first points were scored by the Jets on the opening kickoff return for a touchdown by Brad Smith.\n\nSo, the answer should be Brad Smith.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check.\n\n- The game starts with a kickoff returned by Brad Smith for a touchdown.\n\n- A touchdown is worth 7 points.\n\n- So, Brad Smith scored the first 7 points of the game.\n\n- Before that, no other scoring events are mentioned.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts. Murray extended his 100-yard game rushing streak to eight games with 19 carries for 141 yards vs Washington. The game was the 107th meeting in 54 years between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. After the loss to Washington, the Cowboys now have a total of 64 wins to 41 losses and 2 ties in 54 years. Including the loss to the Redskins on Monday Night, the Cowboys have played in a total of 75 Monday Night games and have an overall record of 43-32.

Afterwards, San Diego tied the game again as QB Philip Rivers completed a 38-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the second quarter, the Chargers pulled away as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run in the third quarter and a 28-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. His two rushing touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. The game also gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs.

Also, CB Antonio Cromartie recorded 2 INT to bring his league leading total to 8.How many yards longer was LaDainian Tomlinson's first touchdown compared to his second?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this problem here about a football game between the Chargers and the Chiefs. It's from way back in 2007, Week 13 of the AFC West rematch. The text goes through the game quarter by quarter, describing the scoring plays and some notable achievements by players.\n\nThe specific question is: \"How many yards longer was LaDainian Tomlinson's first touchdown compared to his second?\"\n\nOkay, so I need to find out the yardage of Tomlinson's two touchdown runs and then find the difference between them.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n- In the third quarter, LaDainian Tomlinson got a 31-yard TD run.\n\n- In the fourth quarter, he got a 28-yard TD run.\n\nSo, his first touchdown was 31 yards, and his second was 28 yards.\n\nTo find out how many yards longer the first touchdown was compared to the second, I need to subtract the second touchdown's yardage from the first's.\n\nThat is: 31 yards - 28 yards = 3 yards.\n\nSo, the first touchdown was 3 yards longer than the second.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The question asks how many yards longer the first touchdown was compared to the second. If the first was 31 yards and the second was 28 yards, then yes, the first is longer by 3 yards.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the context of the game or if there's any other information that might affect this simple subtraction.\n\nLooking back at the text, it mentions that these touchdowns helped him surpass Walter Payton for third place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list. That's interesting, but it doesn't affect the yardage of the touchdowns.\n\nIt also mentions that this game gave him his 3rd-straight 100-yard game against the Chiefs, and that CB Antonio Cromartie recorded 2 INTs to bring his league-leading total to 8. Again, these are nice facts but don't impact the specific yardage of Tomlinson's touchdowns.\n\nSo, sticking to the question at hand: 31 yards minus 28 yards equals 3 yards.\n\nTherefore, the first touchdown was 3 yards longer than the second.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me consider if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me by providing multiple scores in the game, but actually, it's only asking about Tomlinson's two touchdown runs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the touchdowns are not in chronological order, but according to the text, the 31-yard run was in the third quarter and the 28-yard run was in the fourth quarter, so the first one mentioned is indeed the first one in terms of time.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether \"first\" and \"second\" refer to the order in which they occurred in the game or in terms of yardage. But the text clearly states the sequence: first the 31-yard run in the third quarter, then the 28-yard run in the fourth quarter.\n\nSo, no ambiguity there.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Colt McCoy completed 83.3 percent of his passes, (25-30 for 299 yds) the most in Redskins history by a quarterback with at least 30 attempts.
