            "question": "Given the question statement:This is my all-time favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; like I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket and Let's Face the Music and Dance. If I remember correctly, this was the film that introduced me to Fred Astaire so I suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr*p but I'm woman so get over it)All in all this film gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was superb and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more awesome.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to analyze. The user is talking about a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film, and they seem really fond of it. They mention that it's their all-time favorite and that the dialogue is cute, funny, and clever. They also highlight specific songs from the film that they enjoy, like \"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket\" and \"Let's Face the Music and Dance.\" It's interesting that this film introduced them to Fred Astaire, and because of that, it holds a special place in their heart. They even apologize for being sentimental but justify it by saying they're a woman, which adds a personal touch to the review.\n\nThe reviewer gives the film an 8 out of 10, praising the choreography and noting that Lucille Ball is in it, which they think makes it even more awesome. At the end, there's a instruction to determine if the sentence is positive or negative, with 1 being positive and 0 being negative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the main sentiment of this review is. The user expresses a lot of positive feelings about the film. They call it their all-time favorite, appreciate the dialogue, enjoy the songs, and value the choreography. They also express excitement about Lucille Ball being in it. The only slightly negative thing is that they give it an 8 out of 10, which isn't perfect, but overall, the review is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nMoreover, the instruction at the end seems a bit out of place because the entire review is positive, but it asks to determine if a specific sentence is positive or negative. However, no specific sentence is indicated, so I assume it's referring to the entire review.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you. If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\n                                ## Response:\n                                ### Deep Thinking:\n                                The review describes the film positively, mentioning a fascinating backstory and good performances despite some technical limitations.\n\n                                ### Answer:\n                                The final answer in \boxed{1}. \n\n\n                                # Example 2:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                When this movie first came out back in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts around.

Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all-time classic comedy, especially their rendition of \"The Password\", which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their \"who's on first\" baseball routine.<br /><br />Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Well, what to say...<br /><br />Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was?? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick... Round and Round and Round.... You get the idea...<br /><br />VERY VERY Strange accents at many points.... \"Those that should know, know\"<br /><br />Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if a particular sentence is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of this sentence. It's part of a larger text that seems to be a review or reaction to a film. The reviewer mentions some specific issues they had with the film, like \"V.Dodgy camera moves\" that made them feel sick, and \"VERY VERY Strange accents.\" So, overall, it seems like the reviewer didn't enjoy the film and had some strong negative reactions to it.\n\nNow, looking at the specific sentence: \"Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nThis sentence is a bit convoluted, but let's break it down.\n\nThe phrase \"Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...\" seems to be suggesting that the only reasons someone should watch the film are if they don't have to pay for it, if they're being compensated for watching it, or if they're being coerced into it by their partner as some sort of chore or obligation.\n\nIn other words, the reviewer is implying that there's no real reason to watch the film unless you have some external incentive to do so. This comes across as highly negative\u2014suggesting that the film isn't worth watching for its own merits.\n\nThe latter part of the sentence, \"...If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0,\" seems to be instructions for how to interpret the sentiment of the sentence. If someone thinks the sentence is positive, they should answer 1; if they think it's negative, they should answer 0.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it.

It's a movie review, and from the beginning, it seems like the person really didn't enjoy the movie at all. They call it a \"horrible movie\" and say they have only themselves to be angry with for watching it. They mention that they loved another movie called \"War Games,\" but this one was a disappointment.\n\nThe reviewer expresses regret for watching the movie and even says they'll live to regret that decision for the rest of their life, which sounds very dramatic and negative. They also criticize the plot, dialogue, and acting, calling them very bad.

The sentence is about a movie, and it seems like the person who wrote this didn't really enjoy it. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they say it's a \"sloppily directed, witless comedy.\" That sounds pretty negative right there. \"Sloppily directed\" means the person thinks the movie was poorly made, and \"witless\" suggests that it lacks humor or intelligence. So, already, it's not looking good for the positivity of this review.\n\nNext, it says it's supposed to spoof classic 50s alien invasion films, but \"really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects).\" So, here, the reviewer acknowledges that the movie has good makeup effects, which is a positive point. But overall, they're saying it's not better than the movies it's spoofing, which seems negative.\n\nThen there's this comparison to other spoofs like \"Casino Royale\" and \"Our Man Flint,\" saying that spoofs worse than their targets are doomed to fail. Since they consider this movie to be worse than the originals, that's another negative point.\n\nFinally, they mention that after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you'll be begging for peace and quiet.

            "question": "Given the question statement:SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to analyze. It's about a movie called \"Sweet Sixteen\" from 1983. The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about it, but overall, it sounds like they didn't enjoy it too much. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they describe the plot: a 15-year-old girl named Melissa moves to a desert town, and people start dying around her. There's a detective trying to solve the murders, and his daughter, played by Dana Kimmell, helps him. There are local Native Americans who are suspected of being the killers, and the story builds up to a reveal at Melissa's 16th birthday party.\n\nThe reviewer calls it a \"below average slasher\" that isn't very memorable. They mention it has a made-for-TV feel, which might not be a bad thing, but in this context, it seems like a criticism. They also mention a corny theme song that plays a few times, which probably adds to the campiness of the movie.\n\nSome specific points they bring up:\n\n- A line about turning people into coleslaw, which sounds like a typical over-the-top slasher movie quote.\n\n- A scene where one character calls another a bad name, and then they become friends because of shared experiences, like struggling to fit in and learning about makeup. This seems a bit simplistic and perhaps not well-developed.\n\n- The main character being 15, and the director including multiple close-ups of her, which might be seen as inappropriate or gratuitous, especially by today's standards.\n\n- The social commentary on Native Americans is mentioned but said to be not developed enough to be taken seriously.\n\nThe reviewer is surprised that the movie has a fairly high rating, suggesting that maybe others enjoyed it more than they did.\n\nThey also compare it to another movie, \"Bloody Birthday,\" and say both could have used the birthday party scenario for intense carnage but failed to deliver.\n\nFinally, they mention that releasing obscure movies like this on DVD is positive because it allows for more films to be discovered.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

That's a strong positive statement. They also bought it as soon as they could find a copy, which suggests that they value it enough to own it. They mention that the movie had a lot of emotion and felt real, which allowed them to sympathize with the characters. They even get emotional at the ending, crying every time they watch it.

The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises. The director claims this is part of a \"Star Wars\"-like trilogy, serving as the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the series If this is true, I can't wait to see the third installment! I just hope I don't have to wait 10 more years for it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read a text, which is a review of a movie, and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should answer with 1, and if it's negative, with 0. The movie in question is \"Fay Grim,\" a sequel to \"Henry Fool,\" both directed by Hal Hartley. The reviewer seems to be quite familiar with Hartley's work and mentions that they are an admirer of his films.\n\nFirst, I need to get a sense of the overall tone of the review. The reviewer starts by expressing admiration for Hal Hartley's films, specifically mentioning \"Henry Fool\" from 1997. They say that \"Fay Grim\" has a similar style and sense of humor, which might be appealing to fans of the first film. So, right from the beginning, there's a positive association with Hartley's previous work.\n\nNext, the reviewer describes the plot of \"Fay Grim.\" Fay Grim, played by Parker Posey, tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks and gets involved in conspiracies and espionage. The reviewer mentions that the plot is completely different from the first film, which might be interesting for those who enjoyed the original but are looking for something new.\n\nThe acting is highlighted as a strong point, with Parker Posey's performance being described as \"brilliant.\" The supporting cast is also praised, including familiar faces from the first film as well as notable actors like Jeff Goldblum and Saffron Burrows. Additionally, there's a mention of Elina Lowensohn, described as a \"90s indie-darling,\" making a much-welcomed return. So, it seems like the cast is a significant positive aspect of the film according to the reviewer.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions that the film has \"lots of surprises,\" which generally is a positive attribute, suggesting that the movie is engaging and keeps the audience interested.\n\nAn interesting point is that the director considers this film to be part of a trilogy, similar to \"Star Wars,\" with \"Fay Grim\" serving as the \"Empire Strikes Back\" equivalent. The reviewer expresses excitement about a potential third installment, hoping not to wait another ten years for it. This shows that the reviewer is invested in the series and is looking forward to more.\n\nTowards the end, there's a conditional statement: \"If this is true, I can't wait to see the third installment! I just hope I don't have to wait 10 more years for it.\" This suggests that the reviewer is enthusiastic about the possibility of a trilogy, but is a bit apprehensive about the wait time, referencing the decade between \"Henry Fool\" and \"Fay Grim.\"\n\nFinally, the reviewer directly addresses the reader, saying, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems like a straightforward instruction, but I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the overall sentiment correctly.\n\nLet me recap the key points:\n\n- Admiration for Hal Hartley's films\n\n- Similar style and sense of humor to a beloved previous film\n\n- Praise for the lead actress's performance\n\n- Positive remarks about the supporting cast\n\n- Mention of surprises in the film\n\n- Excitement for a potential third installment\n\n- Only mild concern about the wait time for the next film\n\nBased on these points, it's clear that the reviewer has a positive opinion of \"Fay Grim.\" There are no significant negative criticisms or complaints mentioned in the review. Even the concern about waiting for the next film is more of an eager anticipation than a negative aspect of \"Fay Grim\" itself.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. It's about analyzing a sentence to determine if it's positive or negative, and then assigning a value of 1 for positive and 0 for negative. The sentence is: \"This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.\"\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It's describing a film that focuses on two families in Israel, each with a gay son. The story intertwines their experiences, but it's not just about the gay sons; it's about all the family members. The sentence mentions that the portraits of each family member are well drawn, and the story is consistently interesting, though a bit bleak.\n\nSo, to determine if this is positive or negative, I should look at the overall tone and the specific adjectives and phrases used.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. \"Touching story\" - \"Touching\" generally has a positive connotation, suggesting that the story is emotionally moving in a good way.\n\n2. \"Relationships within each family\" - This is neutral; it's just stating that the film explores family relationships.\n\n3. \"Each family has a gay son\" - Again, neutral; it's providing information about the families.\n\n4. \"The stories are interrelated at that point\" - Neutral; describing the structure of the film.\n\n5. \"This film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons\" - This seems to be a positive point, suggesting that the film doesn't focus narrowly but encompasses the whole family.\n\n6. \"The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn\" - \"Well drawn\" is positive, indicating that the characters are nicely developed.\n\n7. \"The story is consistently interesting\" - Positive; \"consistently interesting\" is a compliment to the film's engagement.\n\n8. \"A bit bleak\" - This could be seen as negative, but it depends on the context. Some people might find bleak stories appealing, especially if they are realistic or thought-provoking.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the overall tone seems positive. The reviewer appreciates the film's broad focus on the families, the well-developed characters, and the consistent interest of the story. The only potentially negative aspect is that the story is \"a bit bleak,\" but even that is presented more as a characteristic of the film rather than a major flaw.\n\nMoreover, the use of \"touching\" and \"well drawn\" are clear positive descriptors. \"Consistently interesting\" is also a strong positive point.\n\nTherefore, despite the mention of the story being \"a bit bleak,\" which might not be universally appreciated, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive.\n\nSo, according to the instructions, if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1; if negative, it's 0.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity, all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling, unoriginal elements. 'Party of Five' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there's little rooting interest because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate bland awful-acting 'Wes Bentley' mopester. In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher.' Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is about a movie, and it seems like the person didn't enjoy it very much. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they mention that without effective indulgence of the supernatural or poetic elements, the creative team has to rely on middling, unoriginal elements. That sounds negative right away\u2014they're saying the movie isn't very original or compelling in its approach.\n\nThen, they compare it to 'Party of Five' gone manic and genetically unescapable. I don't know what 'Party of Five' is, but from the context, it seems like it's not a compliment. They say there's little rooting interest, which means the audience doesn't have anyone to root for or care about, which is a big problem in any story.\n\nThey specifically call out Wes Bentley's performance as second-rate and awful-acting, describing his character as a mopester. That's clearly negative. Also, they say all the acting is skin-deep, meaning it's superficial and not very good.\n\nNext, they mention that even though the dark-haired women are appealing, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum, and there's no nudity. It seems like they were expecting more of that, but the movie doesn't deliver, which might be a negative point for some, but it's not necessarily a bad thing in general.\n\nThey also note a lack of sufficient buckets of blood, which is a common element in horror movies. Since it's called a horror film, the absence of blood might be disappointing for fans of the genre.\n\nThe directors are named 'Butcher,' which perhaps sets expectations for something gory or intense, but the movie doesn't live up to that name, according to the reviewer.\n\nOnly the soundtrack gets some positive mention\u2014droning angsty alt-country and a tense fluctuating score provide some palpable tension. So, there's a slight positive there, but it's not enough to save the movie.\n\nThere are some static storyboarded compositions with appealing low-angles that add to the malaise, but overall, for a horror film, the reviewer didn't flinch once, which suggests that it\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60ca\u609a\u611f\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u66f4\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u8840\u6db2\u6444\u5165\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u590d\u5174\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u5173\u6ce8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u6076\u610f\u6216\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9677\u9631\u7b49\u60c5\u8282\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u540c\u60c5\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u80fd\u591f\u9003\u8131\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u4f46\u663e\u7136\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u7535\u5f71\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u6050\u6016\u7535\u5f71\u8282\u4e4b\u65c5\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u5f00\u7aef\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bc4\u8bba\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u8d1f\u9762\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u7684\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662f1\uff0c\u6d88\u6781\u7684\u662f0\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Since I'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It is a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.<br /><br />The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not on Lifetime.<br /><br />The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.<br /><br />In one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love that but let me tell you girls something... It's not as easy as it's always made to look.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this task to evaluate a specific sentence from a text and determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.\" I need to decide if this is a positive (1) or negative (0) statement.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the context a bit. The text seems to be a review of a movie, specifically a Lifetime movie. The reviewer mentions that they read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it, but now they're watching the movie version while home sick. They comment on the cast, comparing the female actors to those from Desperate Housewives and describing the male actors as effeminate. There's also a specific critique about a scene where a female character kicks a male character in the testicles to save her life, and the reviewer comments on the realism of that action.\n\nOverall, the review seems mixed. There are some negative points about the casting and the portrayal of actions, but also some positive elements, like getting chills during the movie.\n\nFocusing back on the specific sentence: \"It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.\" This sentence starts by saying \"it wasn't all bad,\" which is a positive assertion. It acknowledges that there were some good aspects to the movie beyond just the negative points mentioned earlier.\n\nGetting chills is generally considered a positive experience in the context of enjoying a movie. It suggests that the movie was able to evoke strong emotional responses from the viewer, which is often a sign of good storytelling or effective filmmaking.\n\nThe reviewer also says they \"have to credit someone with that,\" which implies that they recognize and appreciate the effort or skill that went into creating those chilling moments.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman, so why rowing against Yale.

The user doesn't think he would have, and implies that Hogan would have been right. This suggests that the user disagrees with the protagonist's actions in the movie.\n\n2. **National pride and rowing for another team**: The user is Italian and wouldn't row for another team, like the French, because they are in love with Juliette Binoche. This seems like a personal aside, but it might be related to the movie's premise, where the protagonist rows for Yale, possibly representing another country.\n\n3. **Romantic interest**: The protagonist falls in love with a fellow countrywoman at the end, which confuses the user as to why he would row for another team. This suggests that the user thinks the protagonist's actions are inconsistent with his personal feelings.\n\n4. **Acting performance**: The user says that all the players act very poorly, which is a clear negative comment about the movie's acting.\n\n5. **\"Dead Poets Society\" atmosphere**: The user mentions hating the \"Dead Poets Society\" atmosphere, indicating that they dislike a similar tone or theme in this movie as well.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.<br /><br />It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.<br /><br />Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.<br /><br />The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.<br /><br />I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.<br /><br />www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative, right? The options are 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's dive into this.\n\nFirst off, the text is a review of a movie called \"Ecstasy\" from 1933, starring Hedy Lamarr. The reviewer seems really enthusiastic right from the start, talking about Hedy Lamarr as the \"most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.\" That sounds pretty positive to me.\n\nThey describe the beginning of the movie where Hedy Lamarr's character, Eva, is on her wedding night, and the scene is portrayed in a way that captures her talent and beauty. The reviewer mentions \"gorgeous camera angles\" and \"pristine shot framing,\" which are all positive adjectives.\n\nThen, there's a mention of the film being considered shocking and scandalous for its time, with Hedy Lamarr being the first person to appear nude in a major film. The reviewer notes that this controversy made the film a must-see, which seems to be presented as a positive aspect because it gained her worldwide fame and caught the attention of a prominent film studio executive.\n\nThe review continues to describe some of the scenes, calling them \"erotic\" and \"blatant waves of eroticism,\" but the reviewer also mentions that the director, Gustav Machaty, was clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. This is presented as a positive directing choice.\n\nTowards the end, the reviewer talks about the film taking unexpected turns in the final act, making for a great story and a lovely debut for Hedy Lamarr. The review concludes by highly recommending the film, urging readers to seek it out in its restored form on DVD, and calling it a \"memorable early treasure.\"\n\nThroughout the review, the language used is overwhelmingly positive. Phrases like \"glorious introduction,\" \"considered shocking for its time,\" \"worldwide fame,\" \"brave performance,\" \"supreme well done,\" \"compelling story,\" \"direction is ahead of its time,\" and \"memorable early treasure\" all indicate a positive opinion of the film.\n\nThere are no\u660e\u663e negative comments in the review. Even the controversial aspects of the film are presented as positive because they contributed to its success and Hedy Lamarr's career.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching. I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival. Please never see this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read this text, which is a comment about a documentary, and determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative. If it's positive, I should answer with 1; if it's negative, 0. Okay, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. It starts with \"This is the worst documentary to come out of Canada ever!!!!\" Wow, that sounds really strong. The use of \"worst\" and multiple exclamation points indicates that the person is extremely dissatisfied with the documentary. So, right off the bat, this seems negative.\n\nNext, they say, \"I'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie.\" This suggests that the person is happy there aren't more films from these creators, which again implies that they didn't enjoy this one.\n\nThen, there's \"All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching.\" This seems like the person is criticizing the creative process, implying that the filmmakers are compromising their original vision to please others. That doesn't sound positive.\n\nThe next part is, \"I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival.\" This indicates that the person wanted to leave the theater quickly, which suggests they didn't enjoy the film and wanted to minimize their time watching it.\n\nFinally, there's \"Please never see this film.\" This is a direct recommendation against watching the movie, which is clearly negative.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This movie really sucks. It's like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot. It's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III. Don't waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being said here. The person is expressing their opinion about a movie, specifically a sequel to the \"Tremors\" series. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting with \"This movie really sucks.\" That's pretty straightforward. \"Sucks\" is a colloquial way of saying something is very bad. So, that's clearly negative.\n\nNext, \"It's like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot.\" Again, comparing it to TV movies that have bad cast and plot\u2014that's not a compliment. More negativity.\n\nThen, \"It's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III.\" So, they're saying that this sequel is worse than the third one. Assuming that the third one wasn't great to begin with, but even if it was, making something worse is still negative.\n\nLastly, \"Don't waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.\" They're advising against watching it, calling it \"crap,\" which is obviously negative. They even say not to watch it even if you like the series, which emphasizes their negative opinion.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The options are 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully. It seems like someone is talking about a prequel story of Modesty Blaise, created by Lee and Janet Batchler. They mention that these authors were given \"the dream job\" to tell a prequel story that fans hadn't seen before. That sounds pretty exciting and positive right from the start.\n\nThe reviewer then says that Lee and Janet admitted to making changes in Modesty's origin to make the story smoother. They also note that \"purists\" might have an issue with that, but the reviewer seems to accept it, considering that Modesty might not have been telling the whole truth to Miklos, and that she was stalling for time. So, the reviewer is being understanding and open to the creative choices made by the authors.\n\nNext, the reviewer mentions that they bought the DVD instead of renting or borrowing it, and they don't want a refund. That suggests they are satisfied with their purchase, which is a positive sign. They also watched it three times without sleeping through it, which indicates that they found it engaging and enjoyable.\n\nThe reviewer praises the dialog and the well-drawn characters, saying they cared about even the bad guy, Miklos. This is comparable to their enjoyment of the novels and comic strips, which are presumably highly regarded by the fan base. So, they're placing this prequel on par with other beloved works, which is definitely positive.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer expresses enthusiasm for future Modesty and Willie films, especially if this prequel is an indication of what's to come.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about a movie, and I need to figure out if it's positive or negative, right? The task is to read this review and decide whether it's positive (answer 1) or negative (answer 0). Let's see.\n\nFirst, the movie features characters like Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, and General Custer. That sounds like a Western, probably set in the Old West. The review mentions that Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill, Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane, and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy. It also says that Cecil B. DeMille directed this movie, and that it's similar to another movie they made later, but set in a different time.\n\nThe review starts by mentioning that the movie begins with Lincoln's assassination and deals with an Indian war. It seems like the plot is pretty action-packed, involving historical figures and events. The reviewer notes that Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill, and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and wants to stay home. So, there's a mix of historical figures and their fictionalized relationships.\n\nOne interesting point is that the movie includes Custer's last stand, but the reviewer says it's \"far from accurate.\" That might be a negative point, suggesting that the movie isn't historically precise. However, I need to see if this affects the overall tone of the review.\n\nNow, looking at the actors: Gary Cooper is praised as being \"good as usual.\" That's clearly positive. The reviewer also says that they \"usually don't like Jean Arthur but [they] liked her here.\" So, even though they don't generally care for her, they made an exception in this movie. That seems like a positive remark about her performance in this particular film.\n\nThe only potentially negative comment is about Charles Bickford, where it's mentioned that \"you can hardly recognize him.\" Maybe he's heavily disguised or something. But it's not clear if that's a bad thing or not. Perhaps it's just an observation about his appearance in the role.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie. Its a big joke. Good.. Its entertaining .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film .. I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.<br /><br />Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.<br /><br />Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance. When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras.<br /><br />Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.\" And I have to decide if this is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the overall sentiment of the text. It seems like the person is talking about a movie and sharing their opinions about it. They mention that it's a \"good past-time,\" which sounds positive, but then they say it's \"unbearable\" and \"absurd,\" which sound negative.\n\nLet me break it down further. The text starts with some questions about the movie's plot and target audience, expressing confusion and perhaps criticism. The reviewer mentions that it's \"entertaining,\" which is positive, but also calls it \"the most stupid plot played very seriously,\" which is negative.\n\nThey talk about the actors, Priety, Rani, and Salman, and there's some speculation about a real-life scenario, but it's not clear how that relates to the movie's quality. There's a mention that Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house, which seems to be referring to the plot, but again, it's not directly\u8bc4\u4ef7 the movie.\n\nThen, there's a specific complaint about Salman's \"nakhras,\" which I believe refers to his mannerisms or acting style, and the reviewer seems tired of them. This is clearly negative.\n\nThe final statement is: \"Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.\" Here, there's a contradiction. \"Good past-time\" suggests that it's enjoyable, but \"unbearable\" and \"absurd\" suggest the opposite.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there are mixed sentiments, it's important to consider which emotions are stronger or carry more weight. In this case, \"unbearable\" and \"absurd\" are strong negative words, while \"good past-time\" is a milder positive. The negative terms might outweigh the positive one.\n\nMoreover, the sentence structure places the positive aspect first, followed by the negative aspects, which might indicate that the negative feelings are more prominent in the reviewer's mind.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The task is to read the sentence and decide whether to answer with a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is about. It seems like someone is reviewing a movie, probably about a talking parrot named Paulie who goes on an adventure to reunite with his young owner, Marie. The reviewer mentions that it's a sweet story enjoyed by all ages, and that Paulie is lovable with clever lines that made them laugh. There are also positive comments about dance sequences and the characters in the movie.\n\nThe reviewer does mention some clich\u00e9s, but they say you can forgive them because you cheer for Paulie in his quest. So, even though there are some predictable elements, the overall emotional journey is appealing.\n\nThere's also a mention of a blind woman who becomes a part of Paulie's journey, and the reviewer expresses a wish to have seen more of her character, appreciating her artistic and poetic inspirations. However, this seems more like a minor point rather than a criticism.\n\nThe ending is described as blessed, with Paulie reunited with Marie, possibly along with the young man who helped him overcome antagonists. This suggests a satisfying conclusion to the story.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer dismisses a negative review, saying \"tisk tisk,\" which indicates they disagree with the negative perspective.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a \"I trust only myself\" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />He meets his match in Skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a so-called law man named Gannon (John McIntyre) who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the \"Gold Rush\" Jefferson \"Soapy\" Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for Gannon's profit). <br /><br />Stewart is partner with Ben (Walter Brennan - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean). They are also joined by Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvert). Rhonda works closely with Gannon, but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However, she has a similar \"I only trust myself\" attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He, Ben, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson, Jeff opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach Dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to Rhonda, and Jeff, Ben, Rube, and Renee start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of Dawson. One led by Connie Gilchrist and Chubby Johnson want to build a decent town. But the Mounties won't be setting up a station in Dawson for months. The other, centering around the \"dancehall\" run by Rhonda, are in cahoots with Gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (Robert J. Wilke - really scary in one sequence with Chubby Johnson and Jay C. Flippen, Jack Elam, and Harry Morgan). Jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and Ben for a ranch they want in Utah. But will they get there? And will Jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />The performances are dandy here, including Stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. Brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. Flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab Stewart in the heart using Stewart's own words against him. McIntyre would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing Ward Bond, but his work in Mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And Calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier \"Gigi\" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford. Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if a particular sentence is positive or negative. The sentence is: \"Mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.\" I need to decide if this is positive (answer 1) or negative (answer 0).\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the context of the sentence. It's from a review of a movie directed by Anthony Mann, and it seems like the reviewer is discussing various aspects of the film, including the performances and the setting.\n\nThe sentence in question specifically talks about the director's job and the viewer's appreciation of the results.

It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack. It certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. I didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) DVD release in 2002. If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare. You'll never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player?<br /><br />TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played geeky Skippy Handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'Family Ties.' After a string of direct to video flops including, 'Little Devils''Killer Tomatoes eat France' and 'The Rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. Recently, he has been considering a TV comeback.<br /><br />Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer/ screenwriter. He has written and produced several major films and TV series, including: 'Space: Above and Beyond''The X-Files''Final Destination''Jet Li's The One''Willard' and most recently 'Final Destination 3'.<br /><br />Tony Fields (Sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the TV series 'Solid Gold'. He appeared in several low budget films and TV shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish Sammi Curr in 'Trick or Treat'. Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.<br /><br />Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething Matt Fielding on the popular sitcom 'Melrose Place'. Since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and TV series as: 'The One''Godzilla''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' and the short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series 'Firefly'. Currently he can be seen as Tom Scavo on the smash hit series 'Desperate Housewives'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The text is about a movie called \"Trick or Treat,\" and it seems like the person writing this is really into it. Let me read it carefully.\n\nFirst, they say that as a genre film fan, a child of the 80's, and a fan of hard rock music, this movie holds a special place in their heart. That sounds really positive. They mention that it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects for 1986, and a guitar-wailing glam-rock soundtrack. So, they appreciate the movie's elements, especially considering it's from 1986, when special effects might not be as advanced as today.\n\nThey also note that it was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time, and although it didn't have a theatrical release where they are from, its popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured its cult status. That led to a DVD release in 2002, which they describe as sadly mediocre, but still, the fact that there was a DVD release suggests that the movie has lasting appeal.\n\nThen, they say that if you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music, this probably isn't your cup of tea. But they assure that there are worse films of this type out there, and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, \"Trick or Treat\" is definitely above the usual horror fare. They even make a funny point about never looking at your stereo the same way again, perhaps referring to a plot element involving a stereo coming to life or something similar.\n\nAfter that, there's a section with trivia about the cast members, which seems more informational and not directly related to the review itself. It's interesting to know what happened to the actors after the movie, but it doesn't affect the overall sentiment of the review.\n\nSo, going back to the review part, the person seems to have a lot of affection for this movie, especially considering their background and interests. They acknowledge some flaws, like average acting and ridiculous situations, but overall, they seem to enjoy it a lot, especially for fans of the genre and the music.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most movies of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. It's about analyzing a text and determining whether a particular sentence in it is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" And I need to decide whether to put a 1 or a 0 in the box.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of this sentence. It's part of a larger text that seems to be a review or commentary on a movie. Let's see, the text mentions \"Warning: contains a spoiler,\" so it's probably discussing the plot of the film. It describes the plot as \"corny\" and the acting as \"terrible\" in many cases, except for Fontaine, who is praised as \"great.\" There are specific criticisms, like Richard Ney being \"exceedingly wooden,\" and a particular scene where he lies in bed dying with \"every hair in place,\" which seems to be highlighting poor acting or unrealistic portrayal.\n\nHowever, despite these negatives, the reviewer says the movie is \"juicy and so suspenseful,\" and that it's \"more faithful to the book than most movies of its era.\" There's also a mention of casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress, which was apparently shocking at the time, and credits this casting as a \"masterful stroke.\" The reviewer appreciates Fontaine's performance, describing her as \"just her usual Joan Fontainey self,\" and mentions that the murderer character dies in a specific way, \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.\"\n\nSo, overall, the review seems to have both negative and positive aspects. It criticizes the plot and some acting but appreciates the faithfulness to the book, the suspense, and specific casting choices.\n\nNow, focusing on the sentence in question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This sentence is a bit meta because it's referring to itself. It's essentially asking me to judge whether it's positive or negative and provide a binary response: 1 for positive, 0 for negative.\n\nBut here's the thing: the sentence itself doesn't express any sentiment. It's a neutral instructional sentence that's guiding me on how to interpret my assessment. It's not praising or criticizing anything; it's just providing instructions based on my analysis.\n\nSo, if I were to rate this sentence itself, I would say it's neutral. But the question seems to be about the overall text or perhaps about the sentence in the context of the review.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the sentence in the context of the entire review. The sentence appears at the end, and perhaps it's summarizing the reviewer's overall opinion.\n\nLet me read the review again to get a better sense.\n\nThe review starts with a spoiler warning and then says, \"Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most movies of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.\" If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nHmm, on re-reading, it seems that the sentence in question is tacked onto the end of the review. It's not part of the review itself but rather seems to be an instruction or a question posed by whoever is evaluating the review.\n\nIn that case, the sentence is indeed neutral and instructional, so if I had to assign a positivity score to it, I'd say it's neither positive nor negative, but since the options are only 1 for positive and 0 for negative, and considering that neutral might be closer to negative in the absence of positivity, perhaps it's 0.\n\nBut that seems a bit arbitrary. Maybe I need to consider the overall tone of the review to inform my decision about this sentence.\n\nLooking back at the review, there are negative points (corny plot, terrible acting, wooden performances) and positive points (juicy, suspenseful, faithful to the book, masterful casting). It seems to be a mixed review, but perhaps leaning towards positive because it emphasizes the movie's juiciness and suspense, and praises key aspects like casting and faithfulness to the source material.\n\nGiven that, if I were to interpret the sentence in the context of the overall review,\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like \"Tarzan\" and \"The Emperor's New Groove\" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. \"Atlantis\" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of \"The Little Mermaid\" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clich\u00e9d Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clich\u00e9d as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, \"The Little Mermaid\" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clich\u00e9d film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths \u0096 a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clich\u00e9s, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale \u0096 need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone \u0096 I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.<br /><br />But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent \"Titan A.E.\" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, \"Nadia\", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.<br /><br />With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clich\u00e9d tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).<br /><br />This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film \u0096 after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. It's a review about a Disney movie called \"Atlantis.\" The reviewer seems really enthusiastic right from the start. They mention that Disney is trying to become more diverse, moving away from their traditional song-driven films. \"Atlantis\" is described as a bold step for Disney, and even though it's more serious and rated PG, which might have scared off some families, the reviewer still seems to appreciate it.\n\nThe plot is said to be simple enough for children but interesting for adults, which makes sense for a family movie. However, the reviewer points out that the plot is condensed into a 96-minute movie, which might not allow for a lot of depth. But they also mention that it's an action film, so maybe that's acceptable. They compare it to \"Titanic\" in terms of potential detail, but acknowledge that animated films might not have the same level of complexity.\n\nRegarding the love story between the main characters, Milo and Kida, the reviewer notes that it's not as clich\u00e9d as expected. They appreciate that the romantic elements are more subdued compared to other Disney films like \"The Little Mermaid.\" That seems like a positive aspect.\n\nBut then the reviewer admits that the film is full of clich\u00e9s, with stereotypical characters like the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, and so on. It sounds like a typical adventure film setup. However, the reviewer finds this tongue-in-cheek and even amusing. They seem to understand that Disney is not entirely abandoning its traditional traits, and they appreciate the witty dialogue.\n\nThe visuals are a major highlight according to the reviewer. They mention that the CGI animation is amazing and doesn't overshadow the characters, which was a problem in another film called \"Titan A.E.\" They also note that the character designs have an anime influence, which is something new for Disney. There's a mention of similarity to a Japanese anime series called \"Nadia,\" but since the reviewer hasn't seen it, they can't comment further.\n\nIn terms of sound, the reviewer praises the soundtrack handled by Gary Rydstrom and the musical score by James Newton Howard. They describe the score as dynamic and complementary to the film's tone.\n\nTowards the end, the reviewer reflects on whether they missed the point of the creators' intentions. They interpret the film as an adventure thrill ride with a serious tone, and they suggest that even if some people don't like the clich\u00e9d elements, the visuals and the mythology are strong points.\n\nThe reviewer concludes by giving it a 10 out of 10 score, indicating they were blown away by the film. They mention that they suspend disbelief when watching animated films, recognizing that animation often bends the rules of reality.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Repugnant Bronson thriller. Unfortunately, it's technically good and I gave it 4/10, but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it \"entertainment\". Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. There's a sentence about some movie, \"Repugnant Bronson thriller.\" And it says it's technically good, but it's so vile that it's hard to call it entertainment. It's rated 4/10, and it's way more disturbing than a typical slasher film. The question is whether this sentence is positive or negative, and I have to answer with 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. \"Repugnant\" means something that causes disgust or revulsion. So, right from the start, that's a negative term. \"Bronson thriller\" probably refers to a specific type of thriller, maybe related to a director or actor named Bronson.\n\nThen it says, \"unfortunately, it's technically good.\" So, technically good could mean that the filmmaking aspects, like cinematography, editing, acting, are all well done. But the use of \"unfortunately\" suggests that despite these technical merits, the content is so repugnant that it's hard to appreciate it as entertainment.\n\nIt's rated 4/10, which is a pretty low score, indicating that overall, the reviewer didn't think highly of the movie. And it's described as \"utterly vile,\" which is strongly negative.\n\nComparing it to a typical slasher film, it's said to be \"far more disturbing.\" Most people don't consider extreme violence and distressing content as positive traits in a movie, especially if it's described as vile and repugnant.\n\nSo, even though there's a acknowledgment of technical quality, the overall tone of the sentence is negative. The reviewer seems to be saying that despite some good craftsmanship, the movie is so unpleasant that it can't be recommended as entertainment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether a particular sentence is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris!\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the context here. The text is a review, or more like a critique, of Godard's film \"One Plus One,\" and it seems the reviewer isn't a big fan of Godard's work. They question why Godard is taken seriously and criticize his political views and filmmaking choices.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific sentence, it mentions Truffaut's \"Nuit Americain\" as the best film about filmmaking ever, and contrasts it with Godard's \"Le Mepris,\" which is called the worst in this category. The use of \"ironic\" suggests that there's an element of surprise or contradiction here, probably regarding the differing qualities of films made by friends or contemporaries.\n\nSo, is this sentence positive or negative? Well, it's comparing Truffaut's film favorably to Godard's, saying one is the best and the other is the worst. For someone who likes Godard, this would be negative, but since the overall review is critical of Godard, this sentence might be seen as positive for Truffaut's film and negative for Godard's.\n\nBut wait, the instruction is to consider whether this sentence is positive or negative, presumably in the context of the entire review. Given that the review is highly critical of Godard, and this sentence further diminishes his work by comparing it unfavorably to Truffaut's, it seems that the reviewer is reinforcing their negative opinion of Godard.\n\nHowever, the sentence also praises Truffaut's film as the best about filmmaking ever, which is a positive statement. But since the question is likely asking about the sentiment towards Godard, and this sentence criticizes him, I would consider it negative.\n\nMoreover, the use of \"ironic\" might be highlighting the discrepancy between Godard's reputation and his actual quality, as perceived by the reviewer. The reviewer seems to be suggesting that despite Godard's esteemed position, his film is the worst in this category, which is ironic.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

If it's positive, I should assign a value of 1; if it's negative, a 0. Finally, I need to put the answer inside a box, like \\boxed{answer}.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully read and understand the review. The text says:\n\n\"Okay, I struggled to set aside the fact that in selling EVP as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get-go. I reasoned that hell, I don't believe in vampires but I still liked Dracula so I could live with this.\n\nHowever, even with that accepted the movie is just not very good.

The reviewer mentions that they had to accept that the movie was presenting EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) as real, which they knew wasn't true, but they tried to overlook that, comparing it to accepting fictional elements in other movies like Dracula.\n\nBut despite trying to be open-minded, the reviewer says that the movie isn't very good. They describe it as \"competently made and acted,\" which sounds somewhat positive, but then immediately qualify that by saying it \"doesn't really capture you at all.\" That suggests that even though the technical aspects are okay, the movie fails to engage or impress the viewer.\n\nThey mention \"jump\" moments, which are probably intended scares in a horror movie, but the reviewer didn't react to them as intended\u2014they just thought \"yeah, I didn't expect that\" without actually being scared or jumping. This indicates that the movie's attempts at scares fell flat.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer criticizes the resolution of the movie, finding it illogical. They question why the supernatural force needs to use a proxy if it's capable of doing certain things, suggesting that the plot doesn't make sense to them.\n\nLastly, they discuss the end caption, which seems to be an attempt to add credibility by claiming the events are real. The reviewer finds this absurd and notes that placing it at the end makes it stand out negatively, rather than enhancing credibility.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the \"southern\" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \"Faith\". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. The forgetting....that will take some time.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read a piece of text and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1 in the box; if it's negative, 0. The text is about a movie adaptation of a book, and it seems like the person really didn't like the movie compared to the book.\n\nLet me read it again carefully.\n\nThe text is about John Huston's movie \"Wise Blood,\" which is based on Flannery O'Connor's book. The reviewer seems to have high regard for the original book but was very disappointed with the movie adaptation.\n\nFirst, they mention that the acting performances were \"utterly terrible\" and that the southern accents sounded fake. They also criticize the musical score, comparing it to an episode of \"Rockford Files,\" which seems to be a negative comparison.\n\nThey go on to say that the southern characters were misrepresented, with their accents being fraudulent and their faith portrayed in a comedic way, which they find inexcusable.\n\nThe ending of the movie is described as \"completely devoid of any character sentiment,\" meaning it lacked emotional depth, which is something the book apparently had in abundance.\n\nOnly one actor, Ned Beatty, is praised for his performance as Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist. So, there's a tiny positive note there, but overall, the tone is very critical.\n\nThe reviewer then talks about how Flannery O'Connor's book is known for its creepy, religious undercurrents that comment on the emptiness of faith, but they feel that the movie is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions.\n\nThey acknowledge that they can't know exactly what the author intended but express that they have a lot of affection for O'Connor and her works and don't want to abandon her because of this bad adaptation.\n\nFinally, the reviewer says, \"For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. The forgetting....that will take some time.\" This suggests that while they forgive the director for the adaptation, they need time to get over how much they disliked it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup O tea. They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house, which has a singular half circle driveway, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under, because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Sloppy editing, as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house? The dolly close-ups were also overdone, like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time. I could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was. It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player, automatic top etc. The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends, abruptly.

This implies that the current narrative approach is not believable or interesting, which is negative.\n\nThere are specific criticisms about editing, such as Peugeot being at the house but his car is not visible, which they call \"sloppy editing.\" That's negative.\n\nThey also mention \"niggling little things\" like the placement of the car and question about two guys appearing walking towards the car. This suggests confusion or inconsistency in the episode, which is negative.\n\nThey criticize the overuse of dolly close-ups, comparing it to a junior high drama student's amateurish use of a camera's zoom function. That's a negative comparison.\n\nThe reviewer says that they could \"keep picking apart\" the episode, implying there are many more flaws, but they choose not to because it might be as boring as the episode itself.

That seems positive too.\n\nThe story and screenplay are described as \"close to being up there with a Thin Man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.\" Again, a slight negative, but it's still acknowledging that it's pretty good, just not quite at the same level.\n\nFinally, it says, \"'The Ex-Mrs. Bradford' is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy 'who-done-its' of the '30s & 40s.\" That's definitely positive.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.<br /><br />RDA gives his 'O'Neill' character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.<br /><br />There is a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. The episode 'Solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.<br /><br />'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet 'O'Neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.<br /><br />The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.<br /><br />The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.<br /><br />There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.<br /><br />I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener, 'Daniel Jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. Frasier'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The instructions say that if it's positive, I should put 1, and if it's negative, put 0, and then box the answer. Alright, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst off, the text is about a TV show, specifically \"Stargate SG-1,\" I believe, given the mentions of Richard Dean Anderson and Amanda Tapping, who played Jack O'Neill and Samantha Carter, respectively. The author seems to be reflecting on their experience watching the show and discusses various aspects, from the acting to the plot developments and even the special effects.\n\nLet's break it down section by section.\n\n1. **Acting and Main Characters:**\n   - The author clearly enjoys the show for the two main reasons being Richard Dean Anderson and Amanda Tapping. They praise the chemistry between the main characters and suggest that the actors have a good relationship off-screen, which positively impacts the on-screen dynamics.\n   - Richard Dean Anderson's portrayal of O'Neill is described as giving the character a believable personality, despite O'Neill's wiseass tendencies. The author notes that while others might roll their eyes at O'Neill's comments, they recognize his tactical instincts and reliability in perilous situations.\n   - There's mention of underlying tension or relationship between Carter and O'Neill, with a specific highlight on an episode called \"Solitudes\" from season 1, which is praised for its drama and the depth of their relationship.\n\n2. **Decline in Quality:**\n   - The tone shifts when discussing seasons 9 and 10. The author states that the quality declined markedly during these seasons. They attribute this decline to the original story arc being mostly used up and the new villains not capturing their interest.\n   - There's criticism of the replacement of Richard Dean Anderson (Ben Browder is likely referred to here, though Browder played SG-1's Teal'c, not O'Neill; perhaps there's confusion here) and the performances of Amanda Tapping in these later seasons, suggesting she was phoning it in, possibly due to personal reasons like having a baby.\n   - The author also mentions that Amanda Tapping's appearance changed, which might have affected her performance or the overall quality of the show for the viewer.\n\n3. **Spin-Off Show:**\n   - The spin-off, \"Stargate Atlantis,\" is mentioned, and the author says it has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort compared to the original series.\n   - The main characters in Atlantis lack the chemistry of the original show's cast, and the villains (the Wraiths) are described as improbable and ludicrous.\n\n4. **Special Effects and Continuity:**\n   - There's criticism of the special effects, particularly the design of spaceships as pyramids, which is seen as a design monstrosity.\n   - The use of torches for illumination in these futuristic ships is also mocked, along with the decor that combines ancient Egyptian elements with ultra-modern technology, which the author finds hard to accept.\n   - Some continuity issues are pointed out, such as the handling of the sarcophagus in certain episodes, which seems to have plot inconsistencies.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich\u00e9, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, chased a \"submarine\" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence, I can handle it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I have this task here. I need to read a text and determine whether a particular sentence in it is positive or negative. If it's positive, I should answer with 1; if it's negative, with 0. The sentence in question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The text is a review or commentary about a movie, and it seems the reviewer is expressing their opinion about the film. They mention giving it a 3 because it shows important history, but they also criticize various aspects of the movie, such as clich\u00e9s, lack of plot, historical and technical inaccuracies, and how it portrays black people in WWII.\n\nThe specific sentence to evaluate is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Hmm, this seems a bit meta because it's referring to itself. It's essentially asking me to judge whether this particular sentence is positive or negative.\n\nLet's break it down. The sentence is presenting a choice: if I think it's positive, I should answer 1; if negative, 0. But what does the sentence actually say? It's a conditional statement that depends on my perception of its positivity.\n\nTo determine its sentiment, I need to look at the words and the overall tone. The sentence is neutral in tone; it's not expressing any emotion or opinion beyond presenting a choice based on my assessment. It's more of an instructional sentence, guiding me on how to answer based on my perception.\n\nGiven that, I would say this sentence is neutral, neither positive nor negative. However, the options provided are only 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Since neutral isn't an option, I need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, neutral sentences are sometimes categorized based on the context. If the overall text is negative, a neutral sentence might lean towards negative, and vice versa. But in this case, the sentence is standalone, and it's part of the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentence is meant to be positive because it's offering a choice and implying that there is a correct answer based on my judgment. On the other hand, it could be seen as negative because it's conditional and somewhat confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The sentence is an instruction: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It's not expressing any opinion or emotion; it's just providing directions. Therefore, it's neutral.\n\nBut since I have to choose between positive (1) and negative (0), and there's no neutral option, I should consider which one is closer to neutrality. In most sentiment analysis models, neutral is often treated as leaning negative because the presence of negative words or tone can make a sentence negative, even if it's not entirely positive.\n\nHowever, in this case, the sentence is purely neutral; it doesn't contain any positive or negative words or sentiments. It's an objective statement instructing me on how to respond.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The *spoiler* \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him\" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before. And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The sentence is about a movie, and it seems like the person is giving their opinion on it. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they mention that it's another entry in the \"holiday horror\" category, and that these types of movies fill the shelves of the local video store. That might suggest that there are a lot of similar movies out there, which could be seen as a negative thing because it might mean the movie isn't original. But the way it's phrased doesn't necessarily come across as negative; it's more of a factual statement.\n\nNext, they talk about the plot being familiar, specifically the \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him.\" They mention that this plot will be familiar to those who have watched it before, which could be seen as a negative because it lacks originality. However, they also say that those who have seen it before will probably watch it again, which suggests that even though it's familiar, it still has appeal.\n\nThen, there's a bit about people who are expecting something highbrow like Ingmar Bergman getting indignant about wasting their time. This seems like the reviewer is acknowledging that the movie isn't for everyone, especially those looking for more artistic or intellectual content. But they also suggest that such people should just skip it, implying that the movie is meant for a different audience.\n\nThe reviewer mentions Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, and Katherine Heigl as eye candy, and they say to \"go with the flow and enjoy it.\" This sounds positive; they're encouraging people to embrace the movie for what it is and have fun with it.\n\nLastly, they mention that they loved the creepy mask, which is another positive point.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

I need to read this text, which is a movie review, and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should answer with 1; if it's negative, with 0. The text seems pretty straightforward, but I need to make sure I understand it fully before deciding.\n\nFirst, let's look at the beginning: \"I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must see for any fan of 70's rock. (I hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years!)\" Okay, so right away, the reviewer calls the movie \"fantastic\" and \"hilarious.\" Those are both very positive adjectives. Comparing it to \"Spinal Tap,\" which is a famous comedy movie, suggests that the reviewer sees it in a similar light, which is probably positive, assuming they like Spinal Tap.\n\nThen, there's a bit about hoping they and their friends aren't like that in twenty years, which might imply that the movie portrays some less desirable aspects of aging rock stars, but the overall tone seems to be one of amusement rather than criticism.\n\nNext, the reviewer mentions \"Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off-kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit.\" \"Excellent performance\" is clearly positive. Similarly, \"Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together, but not succeeding well.\" \"Fits perfectly\" is positive, even though the character isn't succeeding well, which is likely part of the plot and not a reflection on the acting.\n\nThen, the reviewer says, \"If you love music, and were ever in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You won't regret seeing this movie. I know I don't.\" This is directly recommending the movie to a certain audience and assuring that the viewer won't regret watching it. That's very positive.\n\nLastly, \"Even my family found it funny, and that's saying something.\" This suggests that the movie has broad appeal, as even the reviewer's family found it funny, which is presented as a positive point.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

In 1950, Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. \"Put it together and what do you get?\" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with, \"and they lived happily ever after.\" not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like \"A twist in time\" which was moderate but better than this. Also, What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. There's a piece of text, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative based on what's written. The instruction is clear: if it's positive, the answer is 1; if it's negative, the answer is 0. The text in question is about a sequel to a classic Disney film, specifically Cinderella, and the person seems to have strong feelings about it.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully and understand the overall tone and sentiment expressed by the user. Let's see:\n\nThe user starts by saying, \"that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen.\" Right from the beginning, there's a strong negative sentiment expressed with the use of \"Worst\" in uppercase, emphasizing their dislike.\n\nThey then reference the original 1950 Disney film, hailing it as one of the greatest, which sets a high standard. But then they criticize the sequel by saying, \"Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show.\" This indicates that the sequel lacks the qualities of the original and has a subpar plot.\n\nThe phrase \"Put it together and what do you get? the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen\" is another strong negative statement. \"Crud\" is a slang term for something unpleasant or of poor quality, so this reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nThe user then expresses disappointment, thinking that after seeing this sequel, it's all over for Disney. They suggest that Cinderella's story should have ended with \"and they lived happily ever after\" instead of having this sequel, which they refer to as \"garbage.\" This is clearly a negative opinion.\n\nThey also mention that they thought the sequel would be like \"A twist in time,\" which they describe as moderate but better than this one. So, even though \"A twist in time\" is considered better, the current sequel is still deemed worse than that, indicating continued negativity.\n\nFurthermore, the user questions the relevance of a character named Anastasia, saying she switched sides like Iago did, but it didn't help anyone. This suggests that the character development or plot points involving Anastasia are not well-received.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.<br /><br />Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of \"Deewar\" and \"On the Waterfront\" will bring home an Oscar. It turned out to be rookie mistake.<br /><br />Even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic. In the original, Brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.<br /><br />Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.\" I need to decide if this is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nFirst, I should understand what the text is saying. It seems like the author is critiquing Bollywood, comparing it to Hollywood and suggesting that Bollywood is just copying Hollywood, which isn't a good thing. The text mentions that Bollywood feeds on past blockbusters and Hollywood movies, which implies a lack of originality.\n\nThen, there's a specific example about a movie directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, which seems to be a mix of \"Deewar\" and \"On the Waterfront,\" and the author calls it a \"rookie mistake.\" This suggests that the approach taken by the director was flawed or not innovative enough.\n\nThe title of the movie is inspired by an Elia Kazan classic, where Brando raises doves as a symbol of peace. Again, this seems to highlight that Bollywood is borrowing ideas from Hollywood.\n\nFinally, the concluding statement is: \"Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.\" This is essentially saying that Bollywood won't be respected unless it stops imitating Hollywood and does something unique.\n\nNow, to determine if this is positive or negative, I need to consider the overall tone and message. The text is critical of Bollywood's reliance on Hollywood and past blockbusters, suggesting that this approach is holding the industry back. The author is advocating for change and originality.\n\nSo, is this positive or negative? Well, it's negative in terms of criticizing the current state of Bollywood, but positive in terms of encouraging improvement and originality.\n\nHowever, the specific sentence to evaluate is: \"Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.\" This is a statement urging change, implying that the current situation is not satisfactory.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

And give it a TEN +!!!If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The sentence is about a film, and it seems like the person really enjoyed it. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text starts with \"A fabulous film.\" That sounds really positive. \"Fabulous\" is a strong positive adjective. Then it says, \"With everything you could want in a film.\" Again, very positive. It mentions \"huge battle scenes and lots of other action,\" which suggests that the film is entertaining and has plenty of excitement.\n\nNext, it talks about suspense and a romantic love story, comparing it to an \"old swashbuckler film.\" Swashbucklers are typically adventure films with action and romance, and they're often well-regarded. So, this seems like another positive point.\n\nThe reviewer says it's \"totally entertaining from start to finish.\" That's a clear positive statement. They also mention that \"the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second.\" Fast editing can be a good thing if it keeps the audience engaged, which seems to be the case here.\n\nThe story is described as \"like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household.\" I think this refers to a familiar and perhaps enduring narrative structure, which the reviewer seems to appreciate.\n\nMoving on to the production aspects, the actors are described as \"beautiful,\" the sets as \"magnificent,\" the costumes as \"spectacular,\" and the stunt work as \"imaginative.\" All of these are positive adjectives indicating high quality.\n\nSpecial effects are mentioned as \"amazing,\" which is another strong positive term.\n\nSpecifically, the actor Gary Stretch is praised as \"really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at.\" The reviewer even predicts he's a \"sure bet for Super Stardom.\" That's very positive.\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies is described as \"wonderful as he usually is. He is one of the great actors of our time.\" Another positive\u8bc4\u4ef7.\n\nCindy Burbridge, described as Ex Miss Thailand, is said to be \"excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even doing an English accent with remarkable success.\" Again, very positive.\n\nThe reviewer then mentions that the film has won numerous awards, and they can see why, implying that the film's quality is recognized externally as well.\n\nSumming it all up, the reviewer calls it \"an amazing Independent film.\" They recommend seeing it for sure and give it a \"TEN +!!!\" which is clearly a high rating.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Jeff Webster(Stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people. The loner can do neither and suffers for it.<br /><br />The caption above plays on Tatum's assertion that he can't live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction proves fatal.

The options are 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's see what it's saying.\n\nFirst, it mentions \"Another very good Mann flick,\" which sounds positive. Mann probably refers to John Ford, a famous director. So, right off the bat, it's praising the movie.\n\nThen it talks about the father-son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. It seems like the author appreciates their roles and interaction, especially since Brennan is described as the \"comedic conscience.\" That sounds like a positive aspect.\n\nIt also mentions John McIntire as being \"excellent,\" which is clearly positive.\n\nThere's a key theme mentioned: \"helping people and in turn being helped by people.\" That seems like a positive message.\n\nAbout the loner suffering, it might be seen as a negative thing, but in the context, it's probably highlighting the importance of community and support, which is positive.\n\nThe part about Tatum's coffee and nicotine addiction being the first and last time on screen is more neutral, just an observation.\n\nFinally, the author recommends the film and even owns the DVD, which is a strong positive sign.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The task is to read the text and then decide whether to put a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative in the box provided.\n\nAlright, let's see. The text is about a cooking competition show that's been Americanized from its Japanese version. The person who wrote this seems to really enjoy watching the show, even though they say they don't care much about cooking itself. They find it entertaining to watch the chefs' intensity and the quirky chairman. So, that sounds like they're having a good time watching it.\n\nThey mention that you could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge, but they shrug it off with \"meh.\" That suggests that even though there might be some flaws or questionable choices, it doesn't bother them too much because the show is still entertaining. They also think that generally, the winner deserves the prize, which means they feel the competition is fair or at least acceptable.\n\nThere's also a part where they express bitterness that John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef. That might seem negative, but in context, it seems more like they're a fan of John Besh and were hoping he would win, rather than disliking the show overall.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

It's a review of a movie, and the user is expressing their opinion about it. Let me read it carefully.\n\nSo, the user says they rented this movie while they were bedridden and on painkillers, which might have affected their perception of the film. That's an interesting point to consider. Maybe they weren't in the best state of mind to fully enjoy or appreciate the movie.\n\nThe plot is about a man going through a midlife crisis who buys a car and becomes more attached to it than to anything else around him. One day, his wife borrows the car, and then the review mentions something about \"zany antics\" following that. It seems like the movie takes a humorous or perhaps absurd turn after that point.\n\nThe reviewer describes the film as a \"snore a minute sleeper,\" which suggests that it's very boring and hard to stay awake through. They even advise against watching it, saying it's a waste of the film it was printed on. That sounds pretty negative.\n\nHowever, at the end, there's a slight uncertainty: \"Then again, I could be wrong... If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The review seems overwhelmingly negative, but the last sentence introduces some doubt. Maybe the reviewer is open to the possibility that others might find something positive in the film.\n\nBut based on the overall tone and content of the review, it's clear that the reviewer did not enjoy the movie and found it boring and not worth watching. So, unless someone interprets the last sentence as a positive note, which I don't think it is, the review is negative.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0, indicating a negative review.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the last sentence again: \"Then again, I could be wrong... If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nIt's phrased in a way that suggests the reviewer is considering the possibility that their negative opinion might not be universal.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a caf\u00e9 in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam's is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam's. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers. But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon SorbonneIf you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:I've read the text provided, which is a review or analysis of a film that reimagines Romeo and Juliet set in Tel Aviv and Nablus, with gay lovers caught in the midst of conflict. The text is quite detailed and emotional, describing the tragic events and the complexities of the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It seems like there's a sentence somewhere in the text that needs to be evaluated as positive or negative, with 1 indicating positive and 0 indicating negative. However, the text is a single paragraph without clear separation of sentences. I need to identify which part of the text is being referred to as \"this sentence.\"\n\nLooking back, the instruction says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" It seems like \"this sentence\" refers to the entire text provided. So, I need to evaluate the overall tone of the text as either positive or negative.\n\nReading through the text, it describes a film that portrays a tragic love story set against the backdrop of conflict and war. The lovers are from opposing sides and their relationship is fraught with difficulties due to cultural, ethical, and political differences. The story ends with their deaths, which seems to be a poignant commentary on the futility of war and the impossibility of love in such circumstances.\n\nThe reviewer, Dr. Jacques Couillard, seems to be expressing deep sorrow and criticism regarding the ongoing conflict in Palestine and its impact on ordinary people, particularly in terms of love and humanity. The text mentions that love is impossible in this context, and that the conflict needs a resolution where no one is humiliated.\n\nGiven this context, the overall tone of the text appears to be negative, as it deals with tragedy, conflict, and the impossibility of love. Therefore, the answer should be 0, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, there is also a call for finding a solution and acknowledging the need for a lasting peace, which could be seen as a slightly positive element, but overall, the tone is dominated by the\u60b2\u5267 and suffering described.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text starts by saying, \"On the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy.\" That sounds positive, right? \"Above-average\" suggests it's better than most in its category.\n\nThen it says, \"Beneath the veneer, it is MGM character actor stunt-casting at its funniest.\" Again, \"funniest\" is positive. So far, so good.\n\nNext, it talks about the leads being straightforward, but the secondary characters are cast against type. For example, Margaret Hamilton, known as the Wicked Witch, and Edward Everett Horton, known for being a fussbudget, are playing well-intentioned characters trying to bring the leads together.

            "question": "Given the question statement:***Comments contain spoilers*** I was barely holding on to this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case, when the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice) and when Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent. But now, in tonight's episode,David is trapped with a paranoid, nut job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and....HE CAN'T DISARM HIM. A trained, experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting, CAN'T TAKE OUT A NUT JOB. Not when said nut job blinks, looks away, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />Then the scene came that let me know that as much as I enjoy learning from the chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged. Don gives David the \"distress word\" that is the code for \"The s**t is about to go down\"; David is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, startle the nut job and......<br /><br />David CANNOT DISARM/KILL/BEAT INTO SUBMISSION THE NUT JOB. The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends up SHOT.<br /><br />I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. It's about analyzing a text and determining whether a specific sentence in it is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.\" And I need to decide if this is positive or negative, and then put a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative in the box.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of this sentence. It's part of a longer text that seems to be a review or reaction to a TV show called \"NUMB3RS.\" From reading the text, it appears that the person is quite disappointed with the show. They mention several things they didn't like, such as the music, certain characters' behaviors, and specific plot points.\n\nThe sentence \"I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun\" seems to be the concluding thought of this review. Let's break it down:\n\n- \"I'm done.\" This suggests that the person has lost interest or patience with the show. It's a negative statement.\n\n- \"Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.\" This part is a bit more nuanced. On one hand, it could be seen as a positive wish for others who watch the show. On the other hand, it might also be sarcastic, given the overall negative tone of the review.\n\nConsidering the entire text is critical and expresses disappointment, it's likely that this sentence is also negative, perhaps with a touch of sarcasm. The person is essentially saying they've had enough of the show and aren't expecting others to enjoy it either, but they're politely hoping that others might find some enjoyment in it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The instruction is to think deeply about it before responding, and then store the final answer in a box, like \\boxed{answer}. The possible answers are 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. The reviewer starts by saying, \"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.\" That sounds really negative. They watched it with a group of friends and after it was over, none of them understood the plot. So, right away, there are issues with the movie's coherence or storytelling.\n\nThen, the reviewer mentions specific problems: the lack of plot, atrocious acting, not-so-special effects, and horrible writing. All of these are strong negative points. It seems like almost every aspect of the movie failed to meet their expectations.\n\nHowever, there's a slight turn in the review. The reviewer says, \"The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny.\" So, despite everything, there is a silver lining\u2014watching how bad the movie is can be entertaining in a humorous way. They even mention that you can't help but laugh at certain scenes, like a zombie being run over while actors deliver poor dialogue.\n\nThe reviewer doesn't recommend the film to anyone looking for a good movie but suggests it could be something for friends to watch together and laugh about. They also mention that it's now a running joke among them and their friends.\n\nFinally, the reviewer gives it a rating of 1 out of 10, which is extremely low.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the overall sentiment positive or negative?\n\nWell, even though there is an element of positivity in that the movie can be funny in its badness and that it provides a topic for friends to joke about, the overwhelming majority of the review is negative.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Years have gone by since Don Wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him, he's also married to the blonde reporter (Stacie Foster) who led the rebellion in the first film, now a new conspiracy is in the works, one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes, and a corporation looking to rule the world (There is no plot to back any of this up) and Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material. However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to analyze. The user is talking about a movie called \"Cyber Tracker 2\" and seems to have some strong opinions about it. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the review starts by summarizing the plot. It mentions that the main character, Don Wilson, has been married to another character, Stacie Foster, and that they're framed by look-alike droids in a new conspiracy involving a corporation trying to rule the world. The reviewer says there's no real plot to back this up, which already sounds like a criticism.\n\nThe reviewer then mentions that the movie is made by PM, a company known for cheap action flicks with lots of explosions and little story. They compare it to other PM movies like \"Last Man Standing\" and \"The Sweeper,\" which they found mildly enjoyable, but suggest that \"Cyber Tracker 2\" doesn't measure up.\n\nOne of the main issues seems to be the casting of Don Wilson, who the reviewer describes as \"charisma-less.\" They compare him unfavorably to other actors like Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell, implying that Wilson isn't as good or doesn't bring the same level of quality to the role.\n\nThe director, Richard Pepin, is also criticized for lacking the flair of another director named Joseph Merhi. The reviewer seems to think that Merhi might have done a better job with the material.\n\nFurthermore, the review points out that \"Cyber Tracker 2\" borrows heavily from other, better movies like \"Robocop,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Universal Soldier,\" and even \"Halloween III.\" This suggests that the movie lacks originality and just copies elements from more successful films.\n\nThe supporting cast is described as overacting, although Tony Burton is mentioned as being better than the material, and Stacie Foster is said to look like she could be better with better material. So, there are a couple of positive notes there, but overall, the review is quite negative.\n\nThe reviewer concludes by calling the movie \"noisy, bland, and lackluster,\" again referring to the leading man and noting the absence of martial arts sequences, which might be a disappointment for action fans. The only real action seems to be cars tipping over, which isn't enough to make up for the lack of ambition in the film.\n\nFinally, the review gives the movie a rating of 1/2 out of 4, describing it as \"poor.\"\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us \"Gandhi\": beautifully photographed, compellingly casted, well written in the measured, literate manner that Hollywood discarded in the 30's, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of native American (or, more appropriately for its Canadian setting, \"First Nations\") culture and standing with \"Black Robe\" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject: Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (England) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the \"red indian\" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning<br /><br />Indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, by most accounts) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North, and this forms the focus of Attenborough's tale. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Grey Owl's wife Pony) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching. A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read this text, which is a review of a documentary drama, and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1; if it's negative, 0. Okay, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. It's about a docu-drama directed by Richard Attenborough, known for his film \"Gandhi.\" The reviewer seems to have high regards for Attenborough's work, describing his films as \"beautifully photographed,\" \"compellingly casted,\" \"well written,\" and \"scrupulously accurate.\" That sounds really positive to me.\n\nThe docu-drama is described as standing out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of Native American culture, specifically in a Canadian setting, referred to as \"First Nations.\" It's compared favorably to another film, \"Black Robe,\" and both are praised for their wonderful photography of \"Canoe Country\" and its culture around 1934. Again, positive remarks here.\n\nThe subject of the docu-drama is Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney, a Scottish man who became obsessed with Native American tales and moved to Canada, living as a trapper and being adopted by an Ojibway band. The reviewer mentions that Belaney had a checkered past, including multiple marriages and abandonments of his wives, but also notes that he was charming and picaresque. One of his wives encouraged him to become a writer and an advocate for protecting the wilderness, which is the focus of the film.\n\nThe chemistry between the lead actors, Brosnan and Annie Galipeau, is described as engaging and touching, even if not fiery. The reviewer concludes by saying it's a good film for when you need a break from the chaos.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? Who's dying?<br /><br />Alexandra Staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.<br /><br />Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and I doubt I'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). I can't think of a single one of Hollywood's \"former waiters\" who could have pulled the role off that well.<br /><br />Fortunately, Blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The options are to answer with a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative. Let's dive into this.\n\nFirst off, the text starts with, \"I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I left it unwatched for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised.\" Okay, so right away, there's an element of surprise, and it's a pleasant one. That sounds positive.\n\nNext, it says, \"Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.\" Here, the author is praising the movie for not falling into the typical action movie tropes and instead offering a more nuanced approach. That's definitely positive.\n\nThen, there's a mention of budgetary constraints helping the movie by allowing more focus on making it worth watching rather than on stunt-filled sequences. The author seems to appreciate this aspect, even highlighting a gun battle that takes place off-screen, which adds to the suspense. Again, this is presented as a positive feature.\n\nMoving on, the actor Alexandra Staden is commended for her performance, even if she's not as drop-dead gorgeous as another actress, Monica Vitti. The author points out that Staden has the necessary class and fire to make the character work, and even notes the physical similarities to the comic-strip graphics. This is clearly positive.\n\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau is praised for being the perfect choice for a Blaise bad guy, making the character interesting and even likable, despite being a brutal, psychopathic murderer. The author also mentions that no Hollywood \"former waiters\" could have pulled it off as well. This is another positive\u8bc4\u4ef7.\n\nFinally, there's a lighthearted comment about how the girls who might have swooned over the handsome bad guy can now settle for ordinary Joes like the author, assuming the bad guy dies in the end.

She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether a particular sentence in it is positive or negative. The sentence is: \"I found this flick ambitious and humorous.\" And according to the instructions, if it's positive, I should answer with 1, and if it's negative, with 0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the sentence. The text is a review of a movie, it seems. The movie is described as \"a bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching.\" So, right from the start, there's a mix of opinions. It's quirky and maybe a little off, but still intelligent and worth watching. That sounds like a somewhat positive review, despite acknowledging some potentially negative aspects.\n\nThe movie is about a wheelchair-bound young woman named Jane Hatchard, played by Helena Bonham Carter, and her caregiver, Richard, played by Kenneth Branagh. The plot involves Jane's last dying wish to lose her virginity, and Richard's reluctant involvement in helping her achieve that wish. The review describes the situation as ambitious and humorous.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific sentence: \"I found this flick ambitious and humorous.\" The reviewer is expressing their personal opinion about the movie. They found it \"ambitious,\" which generally is a positive trait, suggesting that the filmmakers tried to do something challenging or innovative. \"Humorous\" also is typically a positive attribute, especially in a movie, as it indicates that the film is funny or has elements that elicit laughter.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there might be any sarcasm or irony in the reviewer's tone. Sometimes, people use positive words to mask criticism, but in this case, the overall tone of the review seems straightforward. The reviewer mentions that the movie is \"quirky and bordering bad taste,\" but still \"intelligent enough to be worthy of watching.\" They also compliment Helena Bonham Carter's charisma and likability, even in this role.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer explains that Richard, the caregiver, is unwilling to help Jane directly with her wish but is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do it instead. This suggests that the movie has some dark humor or unconventional elements, which aligns with the \"quirky\" and \"bordering bad taste\" description.\n\nGiven all this, when the reviewer says they found the movie \"ambitious and humorous,\" it seems like a genuine positive assessment. They appreciate the movie's attempts at something different and its ability to be funny, even in potentially uncomfortable subject matter.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further. <br /><br />Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird. At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her. Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction. <br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex? <br /><br />These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else. <br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material. I'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The answer should be 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's dive into it.\n\nFirst off, the text is a review of a film, and from the get-go, the reviewer says, \"Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing.\" That sounds pretty negative. So, right there, I'm thinking this might be a 0.\n\nThe reviewer talks about the plot and the characters, mentioning that the central character, Delmar, decides to become a surrogate mother to earn money for a restaurant and falls for an ex-jailbird. There's also another character, Hortense, who's trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to marry her, but she's also sleeping with Marlon, who loves her. Then there's Delmar's brother, Jethro, involved with a former coke addict named Missy, who was sexually abused by her adopted father. Plus, there's Delmar's eccentric mother and her odd friends. A lot going on here.\n\nThe reviewer seems to think that introducing all these characters and their storylines is too much, and the film loses direction because it tries to cover too many things without developing any of them fully. That sounds like a criticism, which is negative.\n\nThe reviewer lists a bunch of questions about the characters and plot, wondering why certain things happen or how they happen, and notes that these questions are posed in the screenplay but never answered. Again, that seems like a negative point.\n\nThey suggest that if the writer had focused on one or two characters instead of giving equal screen time to all, the film might have been better. So, they think the film is weakened by trying to do too much, which is another negative comment.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer mentions that the directing style is \"pedestrian,\" comparing it to an average soap opera, which isn't a compliment. They also say it's a \"huge missed opportunity\" and that the director's last film was this one, implying that the director didn't have much talent.\n\nFinally, they mention Jorja Fox, an actress in the film, saying she tries her best but can't rise above the material. So, even the performances, which might have been positive, are downplayed because of the script and direction.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon \"retellings\", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clich\u00e9d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether a specific sentence in it is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" But before I jump to that, I should probably understand the context provided in the entire text because that might influence how I interpret this particular sentence.\n\nLet's start by getting a grasp of what the text is about. It seems like a review or a critique of a movie, specifically a remake of \"Prom Night.\" The author mentions that they're not particularly fond of remakes or retellings, and this particular film annoyed them. So, right from the beginning, there's a negative tone towards the movie.\n\nThe original \"Prom Night\" is described as not being a masterpiece in the author's opinion, but it at least knew what it was aiming for\u2014horror. This suggests that the author has some standards for horror movies and is about to critique the remake based on those standards.\n\nOne of the key elements in horror films is suspense, and the author emphasizes its importance. They claim that this remake failed to deliver suspense, which is crucial for keeping the audience engaged. Instead, the scares were cheap and poorly foreshadowed. An example given is the clich\u00e9 of a cat jumping out of a closet, followed by the villain's appearance. The author notes that even this basic scare tactic was not executed well in the film.\n\nFurthermore, the author points out that there needs to be a likable hero or heroine in horror films, but this movie lacks that element. The only character the author identifies with is the head detective, who approaches the situation with common sense, unlike the typical clich\u00e9d behaviors exhibited by other characters.\n\nThe text criticizes the film for relying on overused tropes and poor logic in the characters' actions, such as jogging while looking back every few seconds when being chased by a killer or going alone to look for a missing friend suspecting foul play. These are presented as tired and ineffective conventions that the horror genre, and this film in particular, should have avoided.\n\nNow, considering all this background, the sentence in question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This sentence appears to be a directive or an instruction, perhaps for a quiz or a multiple-choice question related to the text. It's asking the reader to determine if the sentence is positive or negative and to select 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nGiven the context of the entire text, which is overwhelmingly negative towards the movie, it's likely that this sentence is also negative. However, the sentence itself is neutral; it's just presenting options based on the reader's perception. But perhaps the author is being sarcastic or ironic, implying that the sentence is not positive, and thus the answer should be 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is part of a larger question or prompt that isn't included here, and I'm missing that context. But based solely on the text provided, including this sentence, I would interpret the overall tone as negative, and therefore, if I had to choose, I'd say the answer is 0, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider the sentence in isolation. \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems like a straightforward instruction: assign 1 if positive, 0 if negative. But since the sentence is an instruction and doesn't express an opinion or emotion, it's neutral. Therefore, in terms of sentiment analysis, it's neither positive nor negative, but since the options are only 1 for positive and 0 for negative, perhaps neutral should be considered as negative in this binary choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether the reader can identify that the sentence itself is neutral, but in the given binary choice, there's no option for neutral, so perhaps the answer would still be 0, indicating not positive.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that the sentence is part of the review, and since the entire review is negative, this sentence should be considered negative by association.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentence is meant to be self-referential or meta, commenting on the act of labeling sentences as positive or negative, but that seems unlikely in this context.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Me and my girlfriend, Annette, watched this together and we'll both comment.<br /><br />Both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with Dicken's work. A lot of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all that. It was fun, colourful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more lighthearted.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Normally, I don't care a lot for musical and dance movies, but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was awesome.<br /><br />ANNETTE: That's really saying a lot coming from Travis. I can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were. You can tell, for example, that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really do a good villain. That one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back...AWESOME. And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she got killed). She can sing too! Kudos to the casting department on their choices there. I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho. He was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste. (I kept wishing Bill Sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene.) And they shouldn't have had him sing either.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Acting was truly superb. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny, and at the same time lightly sinister too. The supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe carried his Mr. Bumble role extremely well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another movie entitled \"Davy\" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been in a lot more movies.<br /><br />TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book, but IMO it was more robust. This movie was not boring either, as some musicals seem to be. And the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters. The tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Any musical movie which Travis watches completely has to be a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy-to-watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end. In a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude.<br /><br />Our combined rating for this was 8.5 of 10. (We'll round up to 9 in this case.).<br /><br />TRAVIS: I rated this a 7 mainly because the Oliver Twist kid (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding movie.<br /><br />ANNETTE: My rating is a 10. Movies don't get much better than this. And you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was...a masterpiece.<br /><br />Please don't miss this one...even if you normally don't like musicals. It really is a rare treat.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So Travis and Annette watched the movie \"Oliver!\" together, which is based on Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist.\" They both enjoyed it, even though it took some liberties with the original story. Dickens' works are often dark and dreary, but this movie was fun, colorful, and had lighthearted characters.\n\nTravis, who usually doesn't care much for musicals and dance movies, found the tunes catchy and lively, and the choreography awesome. Annette agreed, emphasizing how impressive the dance numbers were, especially noting the hard work the actors put into their routines.\n\nThree actors stood out to Travis: Shani Wallis as Nancy, Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes, and Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger. He particularly appreciated Oliver Reed's portrayal of the villain, mentioning a chilling scene with his eyes visible through a mail slot. Jack Wild was perfect as the Artful Dodger, and Shani Wallis was fantastic as Nancy, with a great singing voice. However, Travis disliked the actor playing Oliver Twist, finding him whiny and wimpy, and thought his singing was unpleasant.\n\nAnnette praised the acting across the board. She thought Ron Moody as Fagin was superb, balancing humor with a slight sinister edge. Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble was also outstanding, with a wonderful singing voice. Annette noted that Secombe had a talent for opera and should have been in more movies.\n\nTravis mentioned that the story, while not entirely faithful to the book, was more robust and engaging, keeping the movie from being boring. The continuity kept the audience engaged without the musical numbers dragging things down.\n\nAnnette emphasized that this movie was easy to watch, carrying the viewer smoothly to the end, which is refreshing in an era dominated by special effects and pretty faces.\n\nTheir combined rating was 8.5 out of 10, which they rounded up to 9. Travis rated it a 7 due to his dislike for the Oliver Twist character and his singing, while Annette gave it a perfect 10, calling it a masterpiece.\n\nThey both recommend the movie, even to those who don't usually like musicals, considering it a rare treat.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is about a movie set in Texas, and the person is sharing their opinion about it. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person mentions that they grew up in Texas and lived close to Gilley's, which seems to be a reference to a real place, possibly related to the movie. They say the movie is \"nauseating,\" which is a strong negative word. That already sets a negative tone.\n\nNext, they claim that the majority of Texans don't live like the movie portrays them. So, they're taking issue with the representation of Texans in the film. They think it reinforces negative stereotypes, which is something they don't agree with. That's another negative point.\n\nThe plot is described as \"weak,\" which is clearly negative. They also mention that the fake accents are \"amusing,\" but in this context, it seems like they're amused in a derogatory way, not in a funny way. So, even that is negative.\n\nThey specifically criticize the accents, saying that they're overdone and that actors from New Jersey and Ohio can't convincingly do Texas accents. This suggests that the production value is poor in that aspect, which is negative.\n\nThen, they make suggestions about what John Travolta should have done instead of acting in this movie, implying that his role in this particular film wasn't his best work. Similarly, they mention that Debra Winger was more convincing in another role, implying that her performance here is lacking.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I'll try my best, though. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. <br /><br />Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. There are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. <br /><br />The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /><br />Well worth the price of rental.

The sentence is: \"Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried. If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. It seems like someone is reviewing a horror film, and they're describing their experience with it. Let's break down the text to get a better grasp of their opinion.\n\nThey start by saying it's \"probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.\" Ed Wood is known for his really bad movies, so referring to him might suggest that this film is also not great, but perhaps entertaining in a bad way.\n\nThen, they mention that they can't spoil the ending because they have no idea what happened. That might indicate confusion or a lack of coherence in the plot, which could be seen as negative.\n\nThey describe lesbian vampires swapping bodies, making characters unclear, which sounds confusing. They say there's no plot, no character development, and random people appear and disappear without explanation. Zombies are mentioned, along with a dream-within-a-dream sequence in a mental hospital, suggesting that maybe nothing is real. All of this could indicate a poorly constructed story, which is typically negative.\n\nHowever, the reviewer also mentions some upsides. Both lead girls take their shirts off briefly, which might be seen as a positive for some viewers. The special effects are described as \"mind-boggling,\" though with a tone that might be sarcastic, given the context. They specifically mention liking the \"incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences,\" which could be taken as ironic praise or actual appreciation for their camp value.\n\nEveryone has a \"really silly Canadian accent,\" which the reviewer says adds to the general level of hilarity. This suggests that the movie is funny, perhaps unintentionally so, which they seem to enjoy.\n\nThe concluding statements are: \"Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.\" These sound positive. The reviewer is saying that despite the movie's flaws, it was entertaining enough to make them laugh a lot, and it was worth the cost of renting it.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The phrases \"dramatic, electrified atmosphere\" and \"experience a true historic moment\" indicate that the film is engaging and immersive, which are positive attributes.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer claims that the film provides \"unique insight\" and a perspective that's rarely seen on TV, implying that it offers something different and perhaps more truthful or comprehensive than mainstream media coverage.\n\nLastly, the statement \"It's something you shouldn't miss\" is a clear recommendation, urging others to watch the documentary.\n\nIs there any negative sentiment here?

            "question": "Given the question statement:As Alan Rudolph's \"Breakfast of Champions\" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's \"Mother Night\" came out. Now for all the talk of Kurt Vonnegut being \"unfilmable\" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being \"Slaughter-house Five\"). \"Mother Night\" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and I cannot understand why. It's brilliant! It stays almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. How many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? Vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see \"Mother Night\" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as \"Slaughter-house Five\" sometimes does). It is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The text is about two movies based on Kurt Vonnegut's works: \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mother Night.\" The author seems to be reflecting on these adaptations, especially \"Mother Night,\" which was directed by Keith Gordon in 1996.\n\nFirst off, the text mentions that \"Breakfast of Champions\" is coming out with \"little fanfare and much derision.\" That sounds negative, but the author quickly shifts to thinking about \"Mother Night\" instead. So, maybe the focus isn't on \"Breakfast of Champions\" but using it as a springboard to talk about \"Mother Night.\"\n\nThe author finds it surprising that Vonnegut has gotten \"two superb cinematic treatments,\" mentioning \"Mother Night\" and \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\" So, right away, there's a positive tone about these adaptations.\n\nThe main point seems to be about \"Mother Night\" being underappreciated. The author calls it \"certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade\" and describes it as \"brilliant!\" That's clearly positive.\n\nFurther, the author says it stays faithful to the book without being stilted or overly literary, and adds a cinematic poetry to it. That suggests that the adaptation is not only true to the source material but also enhances it visually. Again, positive.\n\nVonnegut himself makes a cameo appearance in the film, which the author sees as a great endorsement. This adds to the positive sentiment.\n\nThe author also describes \"Mother Night\" as a \"beautiful film, beautifully acted, written, and directed,\" and places it among their top five American films of the 1990s. That's high praise.\n\nCharacterizing it as a \"mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected,\" the author is clearly expressing admiration and disappointment that it's not more recognized.\n\nLastly, the author encourages everyone to see \"Mother Night,\" stating that it doesn't require familiarity with Vonnegut's work to appreciate it, and calls it a \"powerful, affecting piece of cinema.\"\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story. Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected.<br /><br />Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct. As Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten.<br /><br />But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. That's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver.<br /><br />Once at the diving school at Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all thrown at him, mostly by the Master Chief Petty Officer in charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices, but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide.<br /><br />The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor.<br /><br />Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy the Navy just wish would retire for reasons you'll see.<br /><br />Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if a particular sentence is positive or negative. The sentence is: \"Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.\" I need to decide whether this is positive (answer 1) or negative (answer 0).\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the context of the entire text to make sure I'm interpreting this sentence correctly. The text is a review or commentary on the film \"Men Of Honor,\" which is based on Carl Brashear's life story. The reviewer seems to appreciate the film and the inspiration it provides, especially considering the Civil Rights era backdrop.\n\nThe reviewer mentions that Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., is an inspiration for minority groups who are unwilling to accept their expected social status. There's a comparison to Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball, suggesting that Brashear had a similar impact in the Navy.\n\nThe text discusses the challenges Brashear faced in the Navy, where there were restrictions on what roles black men could occupy. Despite these obstacles, Brashear applied to become a Navy deep sea diver, which was not an option for him initially. This shows his determination and ambition, traits that are generally viewed positively.\n\nAt diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Brashear faces prejudice, particularly from the Master Chief Petty Officer, played by Robert DeNiro. However, the reviewer notes that DeNiro's character is a hero and can inspire others once one looks past racial prejudices. This suggests that the film handles complex issues like racism and personal growth in a nuanced way.\n\nThe reviewer highlights the chemistry between Gooding and DeNiro, which seems to be a positive aspect of the film. Additionally, other performances are commended, such as Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school.\n\nFinally, the sentence in question describes \"Men Of Honor\" as \"an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.\" The words \"inspiring,\" \"courage,\" and \"ability to change\" all carry positive connotations. \"Inspiring\" suggests that the film motivates and encourages viewers, which is generally seen as a positive quality. \"Courage to spare\" indicates that the characters are brave and resilient, traits that are admired. \"Ability to change\" implies personal growth and overcoming obstacles, which is also positive.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems clear that the sentence is positive. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nHowever, to ensure there's no ambiguity, I should consider whether the sentence might be sarcasm or irony, where positive words are used to express negative sentiments. But there's no indication in the text that the reviewer is being sarcastic. The overall tone of the review is appreciative and admiring of the film and its subjects.\n\nMoreover, the reviewer mentions that the film is \"inspiring\" and highlights the courage and ability to change of the characters, which aligns with positive\u8bc4\u4ef7. There are no qualifying statements that would suggest otherwise.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

If it's positive, the answer is 1; if it's negative, it's 0. Okay, let's read through this carefully.\n\nThe text seems to be a review of some sort, probably a movie or a show. The person says it's \"exceedingly complicated and drab.\" That sounds negative. They mention they're a bright guy, but it was too much for a tired brain. So, even for an intelligent person, it was too complex when not fully alert. That doesn't sound like a compliment.\n\nThey suggest that it would benefit from early clues about the characters and their actions. So, they found it confusing, especially at the beginning. They also think it might be better suited for the US market, which could imply that it doesn't appeal as much to the audience of wherever they're from, perhaps the UK?\n\nInteresting, they mention that the director (presumably GC) hinted that this work alone didn't earn him an Oscar, and you can see why. So, they don't think it's Oscar-worthy, which is a negative assessment.\n\nBut then, they say, \"Still, the sand dunes are pretty. The nail pulling is nasty. The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery. The cricket is good to see.\" Here, there are mixed feelings. They appreciate the scenery (sand dunes), find one aspect (nail pulling) unpleasant, are confused by another element (attorneys drunk dad), and are pleased to see cricket, which might be a reference to the sport or something else in the context.\n\nNext, they mention it's very difficult to write ten lines about it, even though it's over two hours long. They're glad it was shortened, implying that it was too long and perhaps meandering. They also mention that they don't go to the movies much, and the last film they saw, \"Walk the Line,\" was ten times better, even though they don't particularly like Johnny Cash. So, they're comparing it unfavorably to another film.\n\nTheir wife comments that George (probably an actor in the film) still looks good with a beard and a few extra pounds. So, there's a slight positive there, but it's more about the actor's appearance than the film itself.\n\nFinally, they ask if they've written enough yet, and repeat the question to see if they've reached the required length.

            "question": "Given the question statement:\"Who Done It?\" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as \"Pardon My Terror.\") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! \"Who Done It?\" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative, right? The options are 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's see what it's saying.\n\nFirst, it's about a movie called \"Who Done It?\" and it seems to be a comedy starring the Stooges, with Shemp, Larry, and Moe. The text says it's one of the best Stooges films with Shemp and one of the finest short comedies produced by Columbia. That sounds really positive right from the start.\n\nThe director, Bernds, originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but due to Curly Howard's health issues, it was adapted for another comedy team. Later, it was filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947. So, there's a bit of history there, but it's neutral in tone.\n\nThen, there's a plot summary: Old Man Goodrich hires the Stooges to protect him from being murdered, but when they arrive, he's disappeared, and his niece and some goons try to get rid of the Stooges. The question is whether they'll find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice. It's setting up the story, which isn't positive or negative; it's just describing the plot.\n\nNext, it highlights that Shemp is particularly funny in this film. It mentions his reactions after being given a \"mickey\" by Christine McIntyre and how she tries not to laugh. It also points out other funny scenes, like Moe's expression through the camera lens and the fight scene in the dark involving all cast members. These are all positive comments about the humor in the film.\n\nThere's also a mention of Duke York playing Nikko the goon, describing him as one of the most unusual-looking characters in a Stooges film, with kinked hair that almost makes him look like a Stooge himself, except for his height. Again, this seems to be highlighting unique and perhaps entertaining aspects of the film.\n\nFinally, the text concludes by calling \"Who Done It?\" a gem among Stooges films with Shemp and even suggests that even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy it. It's labeled as a true Stooge classic and is rated 9 out of 10.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The text seems to be about wrestling championships and the user's opinions on who should have won what. There are several statements here, some positive and some negative. Let's look at each part:\n\n1. \"I didn't like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay.\"\n\n- \"Didn't like\" is negative.\n\n- \"So gay\" is negative, though in this context, it's likely being used pejoratively, which is inappropriate but that's a separate issue.\n\n2. \"Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ.\"\n\n- \"Should have got back\" suggests disappointment, which is negative.\n\n- \"Crappy champ\" is clearly negative.\n\n3. \"Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it.\"\n\n- \"Too long\" implies dissatisfaction, which is negative.\n\n- \"Should have won it\" again suggests disappointment with the current situation, negative.\n\n4. \"I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs,\"\n\n- \"Pleased\" is positive.\n\n5. \"best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.\"\n\n- \"Best match\" is positive.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Negative points: Disliking The Rock's win, thinking Regal should have regained his title, disapproving of Jeff Hardy as champ, thinking Rob Van Dam held the title too long, and that Brock should have won it.\n\n- Positive points: Pleased with Storm and Christian as tag champs, and considering the Booker T and Big Show match the best.\n\nNow, the question is whether overall this text is positive or negative.

After so much hype about Joel Silver's \"Midas Touch\" with action flicks, he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.<br /><br />First, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he couldn't lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper. Having said that, Zane's performance falters about 2/ 3rds of the way through, as he doesn't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug. <br /><br />Can't blame him here, though. The writing, quite frankly, sucked. Let's take ideas from \"Rat Race,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Midnight Run\" and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it. And who's brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan, the \"man of the hour\" of \"The Next Action Star\" shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series.

Quite frankly, we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid-way through, as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him. His dumb-but-lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I don't think so. I kept expecting her to quote Arnie. Her character \"performance\" can be compared only to the dramatic depths of \"Freddy Got Fingered,\" though not nearly as well-developed. The camera loves her in dark, shadowy limousines, but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast, but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. \"Next Action Star\" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell given Jeff Welch's lame script. Someone should take Welch's iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach, even for complete shlock like this. <br /><br />Joel Silver should be ashamed.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to read and then determine if it's positive or negative. The instruction is to think deeply before responding, so I need to make sure I understand the overall sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the review starts by mentioning that the person watched a reality TV show called \"Next Action Star\" and taped some episodes using TiVo. They found it awful but watched the whole thing, hoping to find something unique in the movie. So right from the beginning, there's a negative tone because they describe it as \"gawd-awful tripe.\"\n\nNext, they mention Joel Silver, who apparently has a \"Midas Touch\" with action flicks, but the reviewer suggests that maybe he needs to brush up on his alchemy. This seems like a sarcastic comment, implying that the movie isn't up to Silver's usual standards.\n\nMoving on, the only redeeming value mentioned is Billy Zane's performance, but even that falters towards the end. So, even the positive point comes with a negative twist.\n\nThe writing is heavily criticized, being described as \"slipshod\" and \"sucked.\" The reviewer complains about the ideas being recycled from other movies like \"Rat Race,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Midnight Run,\" and bad gambling films. They also mention two bridge chase sequences in a row, which seems excessive and poorly thought out.\n\nRegarding the lead actor, Sean Carrigan, the reviewer says he plays the dumb good-looking jock well but struggles to carry the film. They mention that the audience stops caring about his character midway through the movie because there's nothing to root for. So, again, more negativity.\n\nCorinne Van Ryck de Groot's performance is criticized even more harshly. The reviewer compares her acting to a Terminator and says her character performance is as engaging as \"Freddy Got Fingered,\" which is clearly meant negatively. They also mention that her presence drains energy from the screen, which is a strong criticism.\n\nThe reviewer suggests that Sean Carrigan could be a good lead in an ensemble cast but wasn't ready for a solo role. They also mention that another actor, Jared Elliot, might have done better with more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell given the poor script.\n\nJeff Welch, the screenwriter, is criticized severely, with the reviewer suggesting that his iMac should be taken away to prevent further harm. This is a clear indication of how bad they think the script is.\n\nFinally, the reviewer states that Joel Silver should be ashamed, which is a strong negative statement.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

You'll look a long time to find a greater Rodgers and Hart fan than me but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Der Bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - But Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's Always You, The Day After Forever, etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad, Once And For Always, plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing. The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most, if not all, of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. On balance it does what it sets out to do, entertain, so good luck to it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Okay, so I need to read the entire text and decide based on the overall tone and content whether it's positive or negative.\n\nFirst, let's look at what the text is about. It seems to be a review of a movie, probably \"A Song to Remember\" starring Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, but I'm not entirely sure because the title isn't explicitly mentioned. The reviewer is discussing the music and the plot of the movie.\n\nThe reviewer starts by acknowledging that some people might be disappointed because the movie isn't faithful to Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart, but he clarifies that it doesn't pretend to be. So, he's setting expectations right from the beginning. He then mentions that Burke and Van Heusen, the composers, are highly regarded, especially since they worked closely with Frank Sinatra and created many great songs for him. The reviewer points out specific songs like \"But Beautiful,\" \"Moonlight Becomes You,\" \"It's Always You,\" and \"The Day After Forever\" as examples of their fine work.\n\nRegarding the movie in question, the reviewer mentions that they came up with another fine but unfairly neglected ballad called \"Once And For Always,\" along with a couple of upbeat songs that are described as \"philosophy-lite.\" So, it seems like the music is a positive aspect of the movie according to the reviewer.\n\nMoving on to the plot, the reviewer describes it as \"flimsy\" and not meant to be taken seriously. He gives an example of how Merlin is portrayed as a heavy instead of a friend or mentor to Arthur, which is unusual compared to other versions. He also mentions that Lancelot is portrayed as a schoolyard bully, which contradicts his historical\u5f62\u8c61 as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness. The reviewer suggests that if you start questioning these plot choices, you might not enjoy the movie, implying that it's meant to be entertaining rather than historically accurate or deeply meaningful.\n\nThe reviewer concludes by saying that the movie does what it sets out to do, which is to entertain, and he wishes it well by saying \"good luck to it.\" This seems like a positive closing statement.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production. The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.<br /><br />Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.<br /><br />The \"hobgoblins\" are, as you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her \"proud of him.\" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.<br /><br />And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film-making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood, Jr.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The options are to answer with a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative. Let's dive into this.\n\nFirst off, the text starts with \"Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production.\" Okay, so right away, there's a negative term: \"monstrosity.\" That doesn't sound good. And \"gall\" here seems to be used negatively, implying that the filmmakers had the audacity to make something of such poor quality.\n\nNext, it says, \"The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.\" Clearly negative. The author thinks the filmmakers are insulting the audience and don't care about it.\n\nThen, \"Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap.\" Again, negative. \"Cheap\" in this context means low quality.\n\nThere's a mention of a 1950s car in a flashback sequence that \"looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.\" That's critiquing the production design negatively.\n\nThe \"hobgoblins\" are described as being \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys. The author points out that it's obvious the toys are being held by the victims themselves, and there's a comparison to a scene in \"Tangents\" where budget constraints and incompetence lead to poor visual effects. This is all negative criticism of the film's special effects and production quality.\n\nThe \"sets\" are called \"utterly laughable.\" Another negative assessment.\n\nSpecific locations are mentioned, like \"Club Scum\" being an obvious diner, and the house being a vacant one rented for a short time. The spacecraft is described in a way that suggests it's of very poor quality, even compared to what a 10-year-old might make. All of these are criticisms of the production design and budget constraints.\n\nMoving on to the characters and their motivations: \"The motivations of the characters make no sense...\" This is followed by specific examples that the author seems to find unrealistic or poorly conceived. For instance, Kevin is degraded by his girlfriend, and the author suggests that any self-respecting guy would tell her to go to hell and leave her. This implies that the character's response is not believable or well-handled.\n\nNick is described as having a nice regulation haircut after two months of Army training, but is portrayed as a sadistic, moronic, sex-mad individual. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but is so effeminate that he's probably gay. The girls are characterized as a prude and a sleaze. The author seems to be criticizing the character development as being stereotypical or poorly thought out.\n\nRegarding the hobgoblins, the author is confused about their motivations at the end of the film and questions why they return to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. The author expresses indifference and suggests that watching the film is an experience in seeing how primitive film-making can be when combined with an idiotic script, incompetent direction, bad acting, and low-quality sets.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

They don't want to spoil it but imply that the villain isn't threatening at all, suggesting that even a 10-year-old could defeat them.\n\nOverall, the user thinks it's just another mediocre horror film that relies on a standard Hollywood formula and fails to live up to its potential.\n\nTo emphasize how bad they think the movie is, the user points out that the characters had at least five chances to kill the main villain but instead chose to run away. This suggests poor decision-making on the characters' parts or bad plotting by the writers.\n\nThe final part of the review reiterates that the movie had potential but didn't hit the mark, and the user describes it as lame, following a simple Hollywood formula.\n\nNow, the specific question seems to be about whether a certain sentence is positive or negative. The sentence is: \"Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY.\"\n\nGiven the context, this sentence is clearly negative. The user is criticizing the movie for poor plotting or character choices, pointing out that the characters had multiple opportunities to resolve the threat but didn't, which likely makes the story less satisfying.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative, right? The options are 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to read the text carefully. It's about a movie called \"House of Games,\" directed by David Mamet. The reviewer seems to have some thoughts about the film, and I need to gauge whether overall, they liked it or not.\n\nLet's break it down paragraph by paragraph.\n\nThe first paragraph introduces the movie and the main characters. The reviewer mentions that it's a psychological thriller starring Lindsay Crouse as a psychiatrist who gets involved with a gambler played by Joe Mantegna. It seems like there's an interesting setup here, with the psychiatrist delving into the world of gambling and confronting a gambler who has caused one of her patients trouble.\n\nThe second paragraph talks about the interaction between the psychiatrist and the gambler. It says that they both are in a familiar line of work in terms of gaining trust, and a fascinating relationship begins. The reviewer finds this interesting and considers it essential viewing for any film fan. They also mention that the film keeps you guessing about who's in control, whether it's the psychiatrist, the con-man, or the director himself, David Mamet.\n\nSo far, this seems positive. The reviewer is highlighting the intriguing aspects of the film and its storytelling.\n\nMoving on to the third paragraph, the reviewer notes that the direction is dull and flat, which sounds negative. However, they qualify this by saying that in Mamet's films, the story is central, not the direction. They credit the performances of the leads and, more importantly, the dialogue, which grips the audience and draws them into the film.\n\nThis suggests that despite some shortcomings in direction, the film's strengths lie in its script and performances, which are handled well.\n\nThe fourth paragraph delves into themes present in the film, such as class warfare, with Crouse representing the middle-class, educated elite and Mantegna representing the working-class criminal element. This adds depth to the film, suggesting that there are broader social commentary elements at play.\n\nThe fifth paragraph states that the film seduces the viewer much like the psychiatrist is seduced by the gambler, and the end result is very satisfying. It also mentions that the final scene is stunning, which is positive.\n\nFinally, the reviewer calls it an extremely enjoyable film experience worth repeated viewings and gives it a score of 9/10, which is clearly positive.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though there are some criticisms, like the direction being dull, the overall tone is positive. The reviewer appreciates the story, the performances, the dialogue, and the themes, and recommends the film highly.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence.<br /><br />The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /><br />Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. But the film floats because of the actors and the script.<br /><br />I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name \"Brotherly love\". \"Country dance\" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text about a movie, and I need to figure out if a particular sentence is positive or negative. The sentence is: \"I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name 'Brotherly love'. 'Country dance' is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.\" And I have to decide if this is positive (answer 1) or negative (answer 0).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. The person mentions that they saw the film twice over 20 years, which suggests that they found it worth watching more than once. That seems positive, right? But then they talk about the title, saying that \"Country dance\" is a farcical and inappropriate title for the movie, regardless of where it was released with that title.\n\nNow, \"farcical\" generally means something that's humorous in an absurd or ridiculous way, often associated with comedy. But in this context, it's used to describe the title as inappropriate, which seems like a negative comment.\n\nSo, there are two parts here:\n\n1. The person watched the film twice over 20 years, which is positive.\n\n2. They criticize the title as farcical and inappropriate, which is negative.\n\nBut the question is specifically about this particular sentence, not the entire review. So, I need to focus on this sentence alone.\n\nLet me read it again: \"I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name 'Brotherly love'. 'Country dance' is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.\"\n\nThe first part talks about watching it twice, which is positive, but then it moves on to criticize the title, which is negative.\n\nI think the sentence is expressing a negative opinion about the title, even though the person has watched the film twice. So, perhaps the overall sentiment of this specific sentence is negative.\n\nWait, but the first part is positive, and the second part is negative. Maybe I need to consider which part is more emphasized.\n\nThe sentence structure puts the positive part first and then shifts to criticize the title. Perhaps the criticism of the title is a minor point, but since the question is about this sentence specifically, I should consider its main focus.\n\nLet me see if there's any connection between the two parts. The person mentions watching the film twice with the name \"Brotherly love\" and then comments on the title \"Country dance\" being inappropriate. Maybe they prefer one title over the other.\n\nBut in any case, the actual critique is about the title being farcical and inappropriate, which is a negative comment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Okay, but to really understand, I need to look at the whole text because that sentence seems a bit out of context.\n\nLet me read the entire text first. It's a review, it seems, about a movie called \"Julian Po.\" The reviewer mentions that they really wanted to like the movie and thinks that Slater, probably the actor, is underrated. They also mention that some supporting players are better than given a chance in this film. So, there's a bit of positivity there.\n\nBut then, they say they haven't read the short story it's based on, so they don't know if the faults in the film are from the story or the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and they loved the opening narration. So, starting positive there.\n\nHowever, after that, it's mostly criticism. They say \"nothing happens,\" and that several clich\u00e9d local characters ask Julian about his intention to commit suicide, but he doesn't answer because it's none of their business. But the reviewer thinks that since Julian brought it up in public, he should have elaborated more, especially since he's keeping a tape-recorded journal.\n\nThey mention that neither Julian nor the director/writer seems inclined to provide more information about Julian's past, beyond minimal details about being a bookkeeper and his family moving around when he was a child. So, the reviewer feels like there's a lack of depth in the character's backstory.\n\nThere are interactions with locals that seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose, but they don't go anywhere, according to the reviewer. Julian seems to view the locals as if they're aliens, acting selfishly and pettily, which makes him come across as condescending.\n\nThe reviewer suggests that maybe this is an allegory, but without any wisdom or defining characteristics from Julian, it doesn't work as one. They specifically criticize a scene where Julian humiliates the naive, religious wife of a mechanic, seeing it as selfish and petty, not inspiring any empathy.\n\nOverall, the reviewer seems disappointed, feeling that the film is half-baked and contrived. They also mention that Michael Parks, an actor who once had promise, is given nothing to work with in this film.\n\nSo, considering all this, the review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment, criticizes the character development, the plot, and the direction, and only offers a few positive points about the premise and the opening narration.\n\nNow, looking back at the sentence in question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems like an instruction rather than a statement about the movie itself. It's asking the reader to decide if the sentence is positive or negative and choose 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nGiven that the overall review is negative, but this sentence is neutral and instructional, I need to consider whether the sentence itself is positive or negative. The sentence is neutral; it's not expressing any positive or negative opinion about the movie. It's simply providing instructions based on the reader's perception of the sentence.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased might be slightly confusing.

She should have been Catwoman in the Batman Movie!<br /><br />If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The text is describing a movie or something similar, featuring a character named Billie Clark, who turns into an \"Alley Cat\" seeking revenge after a brutal street gang hurts her and her grandparents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. Billie is initially presented as a young, pretty woman without a care in the world. But after a traumatic event involving a street gang attacking her and her grandparents, she transforms into a warrior seeking revenge. She's described as having a black belt in martial arts and using her skills to fight off the gang. However, this also earns her the gang's hatred, leading to more violence and tragedy when her grandparents are killed.\n\nThe text then portrays Billie as a vengeful figure, comparing her to a cat stalking prey. It emphasizes her determination and fighting skills, mentioning that nothing can stop her from seeking revenge. She's described as a one-woman vigilante, a martial arts queen, and a crack shot with no mercy. The title \"Alley Cat\" seems to be her moniker in this revenge quest.\n\nThe text also mentions that the film is rated R for nudity and violence and lists some other films featuring the actress Karin Mani, who plays Billie. There's even a playful suggestion that she should have been cast as Catwoman in the Batman movie.\n\nNow, to determine if this is positive or negative, I need to consider the tone and the description. The text seems to be promoting the film, highlighting the action, adventure, and revenge aspects. It describes Billie's transformation and her relentless pursuit of vengeance, emphasizing her skills and determination.\n\nThe use of words like \"brutal,\" \"violence,\" \"revenge,\" and \"no mercy\" suggests a gritty, intense story. The rating of R for nudity and violence also indicates that the content is mature and likely includes graphic scenes.\n\nHowever, the way the text is written seems to appeal to audiences who enjoy action and revenge stories, highlighting the dramatic ending and the clash between Billie and the gang leader. It presents Billie as a strong, capable heroine who takes justice into her own hands.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for \"War of the Worlds\" cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90's. The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a \"perfect translation\". Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic \"dramatic pause\" look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.<br /><br />Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The \"illusion\" of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the \"hero\" gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so in-depth.<br /><br />Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want \"The War of the Worlds\", do one of four things. 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for Spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class). AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read this text, which is a review of a movie, and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1; if it's negative, 0. Seems straightforward, but I need to think carefully about it.\n\nFirst, I should probably read the text again to get a sense of the overall tone. The reviewer starts by saying they're forcing themselves to finish the movie because they spent money on it. That doesn't sound promising. They mention that they heard good things about it a few years ago, but their experience seems to be quite different.\n\nThey compare the video quality to old full-motion videos from PC or PlayStation games in the 90s, which suggests that the video quality is poor. They also criticize the acting, comparing it unfavorably to Shatner's dramatic pauses, and say that even those are better than this. So, acting is a negative point.\n\nThe CGI is described as horrendous, and the green screen sequences are compared to those in old \"Dukes of Hazzard\" scenes, which aren't known for their high production values. So, special effects are a negative.\n\nThe pacing of the movie is criticized as slow and drawn out. The reviewer had to sit through 45 minutes before anything significant happens, which suggests boredom and poor storytelling.\n\nWhen the aliens finally appear, they're described as terribly constructed CGI squids, and the alien weaponry is a spinning silver disk attached to a mechanical arm, which sounds primitive and unimpressive.\n\nThe dramatic scenes are overdone with instrumental music, and the reviewer points out that the characters don't react realistically to an alien invasion. They mention that even with slow media, word of mouth would spread fear and concern, but the characters don't seem to behave that way.\n\nThe day and night illusion is criticized for being shoddy, with color changes to purple, blue, or green instead of actual lighting or night shoots.\n\nThere are many sequences that the reviewer finds unnecessary, like watching the hero gallop around or walk down roads, suggesting that the film is padded with filler.\n\nAn hour and five minutes into the film, the alien machines are revealed, but they're compared unfavorably to \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\" which implies that the special effects are of lower quality than a children's TV show.\n\nThe animations are said to not match the scenery, and the vaporized human skeletons look like they were animated by a high school student, which is another criticism of the visual effects.\n\nIn conclusion, the reviewer advises avoiding this movie and suggests watching other versions of \"The War of the Worlds\" instead, like the 1953 original, the 90's TV series, Spielberg's upcoming version, or reading the book.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this task here. I need to read a text, which is a review of a movie, and determine whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1 in a box, and if it's negative, a 0. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the review is saying. The person mentions that it's the first Michael Vartan movie they've seen, and they were curious about his acting. They say he can act and is likable in the movie. That sounds positive. Then, they talk about Natasha Henstridge, saying she's gorgeous and usually plays action roles, but in this movie, she's in a different, \"sweet\" role as a schoolteacher, and the reviewer found her very good and lovable in that role. That's also positive.\n\nNext, the reviewer mentions some negative comments they've read elsewhere, saying the movie is full of clich\u00e9s and the story doesn't ring true. That sounds negative. They also mention that even though everyone in the movie comments on how good the leads look together, the reviewer doesn't think there's much screen chemistry between them. That's another negative point.\n\nHowever, despite these criticisms, the reviewer says they enjoyed the movie. The locales are nice, the characters are likable and good-looking, and the supporting actors are pretty good. So, there are positive aspects here as well.\n\nThe reviewer then clarifies that if you're expecting a great romance, this might not be it, but if you want a pleasant, innocent, good-looking movie with likable characters, it's very good. So, it seems like they're recommending it for a certain type of viewer.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel\u0085if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs! And Grendel's mother\u0085did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /><br />If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic\u0085.don't, as there really isn't one (other than character names). The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) \u0096 although I don't recommend watching either.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to analyze. It's about a movie called \"Grendel,\" which is supposedly based on the epic poem Beowulf. The reviewer seems pretty disappointed and critical of the film. Let's break down their points to understand why they feel this way.\n\nFirst off, they mention that science fiction has been producing some low-quality movies lately, citing examples like \"Minotaur\" and \"Dog Soldiers.\" So, it seems like there's a general dissatisfaction with recent sci-fi films, and \"Grendel\" apparently doesn't help the situation.\n\nThe reviewer expected some artistic liberties to be taken, but they feel that the changes deviate too much from the original source material. They wanted the \"artistic integrity\" to not interfere with the actual story, meaning they wished the film stayed truer to the epic Beowulf.\n\nOne of the specific issues they point out is the inaccurate portrayal of the characters' appearances, like the horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his crew. This suggests that the filmmakers maybe didn't do enough research on the historical accuracy or the original descriptions in the poem.\n\nAnother major problem is with the depiction of Grendel himself. The reviewer questions why Grendel is portrayed as being sixteen feet tall and weighing two tons, which seems unrealistic for a character that Beowulf is supposed to wrestle. This might indicate that the film took liberties with the character's physical attributes, making him more of a monstrous creature than perhaps described in the original text.\n\nRegarding Grendel's death, the reviewer compares it unfavorably to the original epic. In the movie, Grendel seems to die in a way that doesn't align with the traditional story\u2014his arm is cut off at the forearm after being set on fire by an exploding arrow from a heavy crossbow, whereas in the epic, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm out of its socket. The reviewer prefers the original version and finds the movie's portrayal lacking.\n\nFurthermore, there's confusion about Grendel's mother and how she's portrayed in the film, especially in relation to the dragon from the end of the epic. The reviewer seems to think that the film muddled these characters or their roles in the story.\n\nLastly, there's a mention of \"mullet boy,\" which likely refers to a character with a mullet hairstyle, perhaps Beowulf himself. The reviewer finds this aspect odd or out of place.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space \"bin\" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.<br /><br />The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.<br /><br />Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.<br /><br />However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the \"Terrible movie\" archives and just about nudges it into the \"could have been a cult movie\" archives. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich\u00e9d, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.<br /><br />I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything.<br /><br />Unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The task is to assign a 1 for positive and a 0 for negative based on the content. Let's dive into it.\n\nFirst, the reviewer mentions that in the initial 30 minutes, they were considering switching off because the premise was \"mildly amusing, but painfully bland.\" That sounds negative. They were on the edge of changing the channel, which isn't a great sign.\n\nThen, the introduction of Joe Pantoliano's character offered some hope, and the reviewer decided to give the show a few more minutes. That's a tiny positive note, but it's outweighed by the earlier negativity.\n\nNext, Kristy Swanson's introduction is mentioned, and the reviewer says her acting was solid and added spice beyond just being eye candy. That's positive. So, there's some appreciation for the actors' performances.\n\nHowever, the reviewer criticizes the low budget, mentioning poorly shot scenes, stunted pace, and slapstick handling of certain moments. They compare it to other low-budget films like \"Withnail & I,\" suggesting that some low-budget films can be good, but in this case, the production quality lets it down.\n\nDespite the production issues, the actors are credited with saving the film from being terrible, nudging it into the \"could have been a cult movie\" category. That's a mixed comment\u2014acknowledging potential but also indicating it didn't quite achieve it.\n\nThere are mentions of laughing out loud at some scenes, particularly those involving Joe Pantoliano's character, which is positive. The penultimate scenes are described as clich\u00e9d but still funny, so again, a mix of positive and negative.\n\nThe reviewer seems to think that the film was probably better as a stage play and that the translation to film wasn't successful. They suggest that their lowered expectations might have made them laugh at anything, which could mean that the humor wasn't consistently strong.\n\nFinally, the reviewer advises against picking up the movie unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, essentially saying it's not worth watching unless you're desperate.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read a text, which is a movie review, and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should answer with 1; if it's negative, with 0. The text is: \"I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention? If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what the text is saying. It seems like someone is reviewing a movie and expressing their opinion about it. Let's break it down sentence by sentence.\n\nThe first sentence is \"I loved this movie and will watch it again.\" That sounds really positive. The word \"loved\" indicates a strong positive emotion, and the fact that they will watch it again suggests they enjoyed it a lot.\n\nNext, \"Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self.\" This seems like they appreciate the uniqueness of the movie's plot. \"Original twist\" is probably a good thing, meaning it's not clich\u00e9 or predictable. So, another positive point.\n\nThen, \"I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie.\" Kurt Russell is an actor, and the reviewer is saying this is his best work. That suggests they think highly of his performance in this movie.\n\nFollowing that, \"His eyes conveyed more than most actors words.\" This seems to be praising Kurt Russell's acting skills, specifically his ability to express emotions without relying heavily on dialogue. That's another positive comment.\n\nNext, \"Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?\" This sentence is a bit more abstract. It might be a reference to the movie's theme or message. It could be seen as optimistic, suggesting that even in the face of government interference, there is still hope for humanity. If that's the case, it's probably a positive take on the movie's message.\n\nFinally, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" This seems like instructions for how to answer the question based on the sentiment of the text.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.

The sentence is: \"I was overtaken by the emotion. Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people. The performances were faultless and outstanding.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It seems like someone is reacting to a story or maybe a movie about wartime. Let's look at each part.\n\n\"I was overtaken by the emotion.\" This suggests that the person felt strong emotions while experiencing this story. \"Overtaken\" implies that it was unexpected or overwhelming, but in a way that seems positive because it's about emotion.\n\n\"Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.\" \"Unforgettable\" is clearly positive; it means that the story left a lasting impression. \"Rendering\" here probably means the way the story was told or presented, and it's being described as unforgettable. That's good.\n\n\"The performances were faultless and outstanding.\" \"Faultless\" means without any errors or flaws, which is high praise. \"Outstanding\" means exceptional or superior. Both of these words are very positive.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I was looking on Imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur has beaten both.<br /><br />This out of the many countless amount of movies I've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw. Bad Directing ,Bad Characters ,Horrible Acting ,Horrible story There's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film. Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.<br /><br />The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued stars.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this task here. I need to read a text from IMDb's bottom 100 list about a movie called \"Ben and Arthur.\" The user seems to have a strong negative opinion about it, mentioning bad directing, bad characters, horrible acting, and a horrible story. They also compare it to other poorly regarded films like \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and the \"Rollerball\" remake, stating that \"Ben and Arthur\" is worse than both.\n\nThe user says that out of all the countless movies they've seen, this is the number one worst film they've ever seen on IMDb's bottom 100 list. They mention that only Sam ( likely the director or main actor) says anything positive about the film, and they imply that Sam is a horrible and annoying actor whose directing is even worse, possibly surpassing Ed Wood, who is famously known for his terrible films.\n\nThe director is said to should be ashamed of their work, and the user feels that the movie deserves negative stars, but IMDb requires at least one star to be given. The user then poses a question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The text is clearly a negative review of the movie \"Ben and Arthur.\" The user lists multiple aspects of the film they dislike, from directing to acting, and compares it unfavorably to other films considered to be bad. They even suggest that the director should be ashamed of the work, which is a strong negative statement.\n\nTowards the end, there's a specific question: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Now, I need to clarify what \"this sentence\" refers to. It could be referring to the entire text or perhaps the last sentence before the question. Given the context, I think \"this sentence\" refers to the entire review.\n\nSo, the question is essentially asking: Is this review positive? If yes, answer 1; if negative, answer 0.\n\nGiven that the entire review is filled with negative criticisms about the movie, it's clear that the review is negative. Therefore, the answer should be 0.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's break it down further.\n\n1. The review starts by mentioning that the user was looking at IMDb's bottom 100 list and expected to find bad movies, but \"Ben and Arthur\" surpassed their expectations of badness, being worse than even \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and the \"Rollerball\" remake.\n\n2. The user calls it the number one worst film they've ever seen on that list.\n\n3. They list several negative aspects: bad directing, bad characters, horrible acting, and a horrible story.\n\n4. They mention that only Sam ( likely the director or lead actor) says anything positive about the film, implying that no one else does.\n\n5. They describe Sam as a horrible and annoying actor and suggest that his directing is so bad that he might surpass Ed Wood, who is renowned for his terrible films.\n\n6. The director is told they should be ashamed of their work.\n\n7. The user expresses that the movie deserves negative stars but had to give it at least one star due to IMDb's rating system.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I've only watched the first series on DVD, but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not a \"10\"), and far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there's plenty of action, some of it pretty bloody, the story is character driven. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines; e.g. the priest's relationship (or lack of) with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last very long (a Darwin Award nominee?))<br /><br />Apart from the plot, the script and the acting, the other reasons I liked it;<br /><br />1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 2. The music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read a text, which is a review of the TV show \"The Sopranos,\" and then determine whether the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1 in a box, and if it's negative, a 0. Okay, let's dive into this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. The person seems to be comparing \"The Sopranos\" to other well-known movies and shows, like \"Goodfellas,\" \"Casino,\" and \"The Godfather.\" They say it's as good as the first two and almost as good as \"The Godfather,\" but not quite, which is why it's not a perfect 10, I guess. They also mention that it's way better than Guy Ritchie's efforts, whoever he is.\n\nThe review talks about the plot being Shakespearean with a Tarantino-like script. I know Shakespeare is renowned for his storytelling, and Tarantino is known for his unique dialogue and style. So, that sounds like a compliment.\n\nThey say the series is character-driven, which is often a positive attribute in storytelling because it means the characters are well-developed and integral to the plot. Even minor characters contribute to great storylines, which suggests that the writing is consistent across all characters, not just the main ones.\n\nThere are specific examples given, like the priest's relationship with Carmella and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his dim-witted friend. It seems like these relationships and interactions are highlighted as positive aspects of the show.\n\nThe review also mentions that there's plenty of action and some bloody scenes, but it's not just about the action; it's about the characters and their stories.\n\nMoving on, there are three additional points the reviewer likes about the show:\n\n1. It makes them want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. That sounds like a positive association with the show.\n\n2. The music is appreciated, which is another positive point.\n\n3. It shows that anyone can suffer from mental health problems, which might be a deeper appreciation of the show's themes and realism.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that's no fun!If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read a piece of text and determine whether it's positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put a 1 in the box; if it's negative, a 0. The text is about a movie, and it sounds like the person is describing their experience watching it. Let me read it carefully.\n\n\"A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth.\"\n\nOkay, so right from the start, it seems like the movie isn't very good, especially in terms of special effects. The creature is shown with poor animation, and instead of that, they have people waving around an inner tube with teeth. That sounds really bad and probably not very convincing or scary.\n\n\"No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff.\"\n\nHere, the reviewer mentions that the movie shifts focus to some comic relief characters who are described as \"doofuses.\" The word \"doofus\" generally has a negative connotation, suggesting that these characters are foolish or silly in an annoying way. However, the reviewer also says that watching them try to be funny is better than following the sheriff, which implies that the sheriff's part is even less entertaining.\n\n\"Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that's no fun!\"\n\nThe ending seems bleak and perhaps not very satisfying. One character gets eaten, and the other is left alone, crying. The reviewer explicitly states that \"that's no fun!\" which is a clear negative sentiment.\n\n\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, the last sentence is a bit confusing. It seems like it's instructing me that if I think the entire text is positive, I should answer 1; if it's negative, answer 0. But the way it's phrased, \"if you think this sentence is positive,\" might be a typo or a misdirection. I think it's referring to the entire text, not just the last sentence.\n\nLet me recap: The movie has poor special effects, with amateurish animation and props like an inner tube with teeth. The plot seems disjointed, shifting focus to comic relief characters who are described negatively. The ending is sad and not fun.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The answer should be 1 if it's positive and 0 if it's negative. Let's see.\n\nFirst, there's a series being discussed, and it seems like this particular episode has \"ups and occasional downs.\" The reviewer mentions that there's an \"agreeable amount of spatter,\" which probably refers to blood or violent content, and they say it's implemented inventively with the Baby Cart's weapons. That sounds somewhat positive.\n\nHowever, the editing is described as \"disjointed,\" and the filmmaking is \"rougher than usual.\" That doesn't sound good. Also, the action slows down at times, which might be frustrating for the viewer. There's a mention that the \"cub\" nearly gets lost early on, which might indicate poor plotting or direction.\n\nThe reviewer sums it up by saying \"all in all, disappointment.\" That's pretty clear\u2014disappointment is negative. So, at this point, it seems like the review is negative.\n\nBut then there's a \"that said,\" which suggests a shift or a qualification of the previous statement. The reviewer mentions that there's a \"spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers.\" Spaghetti westerns, or in this case, spaghetti easterns, often have a certain gritty, low-budget charm that some people appreciate. So, this could be seen as a positive aspect, especially for fans who are into that style.\n\nFurthermore, the installment spends time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him. This suggests that there's some depth or emotional content being explored, which might be appealing to some viewers.\n\nSo, while there are negative points mentioned, like the disjointed editing and rough filmmaking, there are also some positive elements, such as the inventive use of weapons and the spaghetti eastern quality.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

I need to read a text and determine whether it's positive or negative, and then put the final answer in a box. The text is about a TV show called \"Pushing Daisies,\" and it seems like the person really likes it. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. The person says they \"instantly fell in love\" with the show. That sounds really positive right there. They mention that it puts a smile on their face, which is another positive emotion. They also praise the storytelling, dialog, and acting, calling them \"great.\" So, that's more positive feedback.\n\nNext, they say the show \"manages to keep you until the end,\" which suggests that it's engaging and compelling. That's another plus. The basic idea of the show is described as \"interesting,\" and they think it has potential for later seasons. So, again, positive.\n\nThen, there are specific elements they like, such as the murder cases being suspenseful, the unique look of the show, and the narrator being highly proficient. All of these are presented as strengths of the show.\n\nMoreover, the person mentions that \"Pushing Daisies\" has a \"certain charm\" that they enjoy. Charm is a positive quality, especially in entertainment. They're also looking forward to the second season, which indicates anticipation and excitement, both positive emotions.\n\nAt no point in the text do they mention any negative aspects of the show.

Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I vaugely recall seeing this when I was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got \"Cult Status\" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling here, I know. I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I have this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative. The sentence is: \"I still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.\" And I have to decide whether this is a positive or negative statement, and assign a 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the overall sentiment of the statement. The person says they think it's a great film, which sounds positive. But then they add that it could be better than great, which might imply that it's not perfect or that there's room for improvement.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. \"I still think it's a great film\" - This part is clearly positive. \"Great\" is a strong positive adjective.\n\n2. \"but it could be better than great\" - This part is a bit tricky. On one hand, it suggests that the film is already great, which is positive. On the other hand, the phrase \"it could be better than great\" might indicate that it's not currently as good as it could be, which could be seen as slightly negative.\n\nHowever, the overall tone seems to be more positive than negative. The person is expressing that they think the film is great, and they're open to the idea that it could be even better. It's not a criticism; it's more of a suggestion or a hope for future improvements.\n\nAdditionally, earlier in the text, the person mentions that they watched it multiple times at different ages and that it's gained \"cult status.\" They also mention that it's still good for kids, but maybe not as recognized by older audiences. They even suggest that a remake could make it more popular.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Still the definitive program about the Second World War, The World At War isn't just long, but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most episodes are about the war in Europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa, Burma, the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany, Great Britain, United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. In addition, some of the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.<br /><br />The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, Jimmy Stewart, Bill Mauldin, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten, Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in \"The Making of The World at War\" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff. The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence.<br /><br />The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, The World at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this task to evaluate whether a given sentence is positive or negative, and I need to put the final answer in a box. The sentence is about \"The World At War,\" a documentary series about World War II. Let's see what it says.\n\nFirst, it calls the program \"the definitive program about the Second World War,\" which sounds really positive. It says it's \"not just long, but also very informative,\" which is another positive point. The series has 26 episodes, each around 45 minutes, covering a wide range of topics related to the war, including different fronts and home fronts of various countries. There's even an episode dedicated to the Holocaust, which is important.\n\nThe review mentions that the series starts with the rise of the Nazis and ends with the war's influence on the post-war world, and it describes the ending episode as \"fitting.\" It also talks about the production quality, like the fantastic footage, both black and white and color, and the way it's edited together. The music is highlighted as powerful and fitting, which is another positive aspect.\n\nThe production details are mentioned, including that it was made by Thames Television in the UK, commissioned in 1969 and took four years to produce, showing the depth of research that went into it. It was narrated by Laurence Olivier, a renowned actor, which adds to its credibility and appeal.\n\nThe review also points out that the series includes interviews with key figures from both Allied and Axis sides, including civilians, military personnel, and politicians. It names several notable individuals who were interviewed, which suggests that the series has a high level of authenticity and authority.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer states that the series is often considered the definitive television history of World War II and that some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. It's ranked 19th in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, which is a significant achievement.\n\nThe reviewer personally enjoyed the series, watching multiple episodes in one sitting and revisiting some episodes several times. They also recommend two other documentary series, \"The Great War\" and \"Cold War,\" which are presumably of similar quality and interest.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD.

The user is talking about a film that was released on DVD in a format that's not optimal\u2014it's formatted for TV and has a fuzzy picture. They mention that this has annoyed a lot of film purists, and they agree that it's rightful annoyance because the film deserves better treatment.\n\nSo, the first part is clearly negative regarding the presentation of the film on DVD.\n\nMoving on to the story: it's about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft but ends up with a little girl instead. The performer buys the child at a slave auction and only later discovers that it's a girl. The performer is described as \"Bianlian Wang\" played by Xu Zhu, who has a missing front tooth and an infectious grin. The little girl is \"Doggie,\" played by Zhou Renying, and she's described as a cutie.\n\nThe review says it's an involving story with drama, suspense, humor, and sadness. That sounds like a positive aspect. However, the reviewer mentions that they usually like a nice sentimental ending but feels that the final 15 minutes get a bit carried away. So, there's a slight negative touch there regarding the ending.\n\nOverall, the review seems mixed. There's appreciation for the story and the characters but disappointment with the DVD quality.\n\nThe specific question is: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\"\n\nWait, but the entire review is a paragraph, not a single sentence.

Just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.\"\n\nHmm, even that sentence is mixed. It highlights positive aspects of the story but warns about the poor picture quality and suggests renting it until a better format is available.\n\nGiven that, it's a mixed review, but perhaps leaning slightly negative due to the disappointment with the DVD quality.\n\nBut considering the question asks to think deeply before responding, maybe I need to consider the overall tone.\n\nThe review starts with a negative point about the DVD quality, which seems to be a major annoyance for the reviewer. Then it describes the story in a positive light but has a minor issue with the ending. Finally, it recommends renting it until a better format is available.\n\nSo, the negatives are:\n\n- Poor DVD quality\n\n- Slight issue with the ending\n\nThe positives are:\n\n- Involving story\n\n- Good mix of drama, suspense, humor, and sadness\n\n- Likable characters\n\nGiven that, it's a mixed review, but the DVD quality seems to be a significant drawback.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be binary: positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nPerhaps I need to weigh which aspect is more important to the reviewer.\n\nThe reviewer starts by mentioning the annoyance with the DVD quality, which they think is rightful annoyance, and that the film deserves better treatment. That suggests that the presentation is a major issue for them.\n\nAdditionally, they recommend renting it until it comes out in a better format, which implies that buying the current DVD might not be worth it due to the poor picture quality.\n\nOn the other hand, they do appreciate the story and the characters, but the disappointment with the DVD seems to overshadow that.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as \"Away from Her\" - or even \"The Bucket List\" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!<br /><br />This isn't a \"feel good\" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text here about a movie, and I need to figure out if it's positive or negative. The sentence says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Okay, so I need to decide whether to put a 1 or a 0 in the box.\n\nFirst, I should probably read the text carefully to understand what it's saying about the movie. The text starts with, \"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried.\" That sounds positive, right? The person liked the movie and even cried, which might mean it was emotionally impactful.\n\nThen it compares the movie to others like \"Away from Her\" and \"The Bucket List,\" saying it handles the aging theme with \"incredible authenticity.\" That sounds really good, so positive again.\n\nNext, it mentions that the main character, Hagar, is unlikable, which might sound negative, but the text says, \"The director does a masterful job with the challenge.\" So, even though the character is unlikable, the director handles it well, which is positive.\n\nThe text describes Hagar as mean, belittling, and selfish, which are negative traits, but then it says, \"Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character...\" This suggests that the movie provides depth and explanation for her behavior, which the viewer comes to understand and perhaps even empathize with.\n\nThere's praise for the actress, Ellen Burstyn, calling her a \"brilliant actor,\" and specifically highlighting a scene where Hagar pours out her secrets to a boy in a shack. So, more positive feedback.\n\nThen, it says, \"This isn't a 'feel good' movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy.\" So, it's not trying to be feel-good, but it achieves empathy, which is a different kind of positive impact.\n\nFinally, the text reflects on how the movie helped the viewer understand the reasons behind people's hard edges and relates it to people in their own life, suggesting personal growth or insight from watching the movie.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.

Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /><br />Though I flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this review to analyze. The user is talking about a movie that features Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger, and they decided to rent it because of that. The movie is about Ned Kelly, who seems to be a figure in Australian history. The reviewer mentions that they hadn't heard of Ned Kelly before watching the movie, so they were learning about him through this film.\n\nFirst impression is that the movie is a \"mess,\" which doesn't sound great. They also mention that it's mediocre, which suggests it's just average or not\u7279\u522b\u51fa\u8272. The reviewer admits that they were watching this at the end of a long movie marathon, which might have affected their perception. They also note that the movie is slow, which made the story difficult to follow, even though the story itself isn't complicated.\n\nDespite the slow pace, they do give credit to Ledger and Bloom for creating interesting and dimensional characters. That's a positive point. Then, they say they wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a must-see but acknowledge its historical value, especially for Australian history, which they consider rare and appreciable. There are also some good action sequences mentioned.\n\nThe review ends with a rating of 6/10 and suggests seeing it for historical value, though they seem a bit sarcastic about that being the only reason to watch it.\n\nNow, the question is whether this sentence is positive or negative. Given that they called it a \"mess,\" \"mediocre,\" \"slow,\" and only recommended it for historical value with a hint of sarcasm, it seems mostly negative. However, they did appreciate the performances of Ledger and Bloom and acknowledged some positive aspects like the action sequences and historical significance.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

(Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.)

The sentence is about a movie that seems to have a unique theme involving bridge, a card game. It mentions that the movie might not be interesting to those who aren't into bridge, which suggests that the appeal might be quite niche.\n\nFirst, let's look at the opening statement: \"This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in 'Glen or Glenda?'\" Okay, so right away, there's a comparison to another movie that's perhaps known for its oddity. Ed Wood is often regarded as one of the worst directors in Hollywood history, so this comparison might not be flattering.\n\nBut, the text says \"strangest themes in history,\" which could be seen as intriguing or off-putting, depending on the perspective. So, neutrality or slight negativity perhaps.\n\nNext, it describes the subject matter: people from different walks of life playing bridge, even Russians who work in a restaurant. It mentions that the Russians speak questionable Russian and have unconvincing accents, which seems like a criticism of the film's production quality or attention to detail.\n\nThen, there's a statement that if one isn't interested in bridge, they aren't likely to be much interested in this movie. This suggests that the movie's appeal is limited to those who enjoy bridge, which could be seen as a negative point for a broader audience.\n\nHowever, the text does praise some aspects of the movie. It says, \"Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine.\" So, there's some\u80af\u5b9a here, acknowledging good performances from these actors.\n\nIt also mentions that Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter, and that Paul Lukas is an unlikely Russian, which might be pointing out casting choices that don't quite fit the roles, possibly critiquing the casting decisions.\n\nFinally, it says, \"But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.\" The word \"fetishistic\" here likely means that the script is overly obsessed or fixated on bridge to an unhealthy degree, which is probably a negative comment.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

This is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.\"\n\n- The reviewer finds it amusing initially that the future looks like the seventies, but then they see deeper differences in the world portrayed.\n\n- They mention \"decadent futuristic world\" and how things we take for granted could become unavailable, which seems to suggest a thought-provoking element in the movie.\n\n- Overall, this seems positive because they find it interesting and thought-provoking.\n\n**Second Paragraph:**\n\n\"Characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. I believe this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that.\"\n\n- Here, the reviewer notes that character interactions lack tact, manners, and respect, but they believe this is intentional, possibly a commentary on social changes.\n\n- They seem to accept this as a deliberate choice by the filmmakers, which suggests they are open to this aspect of the movie.\n\n- This could be seen as positive because they appreciate the intentional nature of the character behavior.\n\n**Third Paragraph:**\n\n\"I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies.

That sounds really positive.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of \"real teen life.\" Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, \"a film teens should see because it's about them.\" Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like \"Pups\" or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this task here. I need to read this text about a film and then decide whether a particular sentence from it is positive or negative. If it's positive, I should put 1; if it's negative, 0. The sentence in question is: \"McKay was extremely sensitive and detailed in his work\u2014aligning himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be\u2014with the results being disarmingly realistic.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this sentence is saying. It's talking about the director, Jim McKay, and his approach to making the film. It mentions that he was \"extremely sensitive and detailed\" in his work. Those sound like positive traits\u2014being sensitive and detailed usually means he put a lot of care and attention into the film.\n\nThen it says he aligned himself with the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film is set. This probably means he immersed himself in the local culture and community to make the film authentic. That also seems positive, like he really tried to understand and represent the area accurately.\n\nNext, it talks about how he worked with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be. This suggests that he gave the actors creative input and allowed them to shape their characters, which could lead to more nuanced and realistic performances. Again, that sounds positive.\n\nFinally, it says the results are \"disarmingly realistic.\" \"Disarmingly\" often means surprisingly or in a way that surprises and pleases. So, the realism of the film is a positive aspect.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny. Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of his \"work\"...and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a \"movie\" rental. Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it. Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness.<br /><br />This \"thing\" he \"assembled\" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage) are terrible in this. Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent (in all fields), desperate to grab onto any \"loser\" attention he can for himself. He is to be pitied.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:So I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether a particular sentence in it is positive or negative. The options are to answer with a 1 for positive or a 0 for negative. The text seems to be a review or critique of some sort, probably about a movie or a piece of art, and the author is quite upset about it. There are a lot of strong negative words and expressions, so it's clear that the person didn't enjoy whatever they're reviewing.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the specific sentence that needs to be evaluated. The prompt says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" But it doesn't specify which sentence to look at. Maybe it's the last sentence? Let's check: \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" Wait, that seems like instructions rather than part of the review.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the sentence to evaluate is the one just before that. Let's see: \"He is to be pitied.\" Hmm, that seems negative, but maybe it's a bit complicated. Pity can be a sympathetic emotion, but in this context, it might be more derogatory.\n\nLet me read the text again to get a better understanding. The reviewer is clearly\u6124\u6012 and disappointed with Sam Mraovich and his work. They use strong language like \"should never be allowed to touch a camera again,\" \"arrested on the spot,\" \"petty larceny,\" \"garbage,\" \"piece of crap,\" \"warped,\" \"exceedingly untalented,\" \"man-child,\" \"offensive,\" \"irresponsible junk,\" etc. It's overwhelmingly negative.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions Ed Wood, who is known for making very bad movies, and says \"Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now,\" implying that even someone considered to make terrible movies looks good compared to Mraovich.\n\nThey talk about returning the video to the store and asking to have it removed from the shelves, and they're angry that such a thing is being marketed as a movie, especially in the context of gay cinema, which they support.\n\nThere's also criticism of the cover, suggesting that people might be misled into renting it based on the cover, only to be disappointed.\n\nRegarding the actors, the reviewer says Jamie Brett Gabel has no other acting credits, and his appearance without a shirt is minimal. They also mention that Mraovich and Habousch are terrible in the film, and that Mraovich is posing as a no-talent, desperate for attention.\n\nFinally, the sentence in question is: \"He is to be pitied.\"\n\nGiven the context, the reviewer seems to be saying that Mraovich is someone to be pitied, perhaps because he's so bad at what he does, or because he's trying so hard to get attention in a negative way.\n\nSo, is \"He is to be pitied.\" a positive sentence in this context?\n\nPity is generally considered a negative emotion; it's feeling sympathy for someone in a\u4e0d\u5e78 situation. In this case, the reviewer seems to be saying that Mraovich is someone to feel sorry for, perhaps because of his lack of talent or his desperate attempts for attention.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Didn't Mystic Pizza win the Oscar for that year? This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater. Only \"Wargames\" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future. History has shown that this is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to \"run\" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as \"Captain Freedom\" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as \"Subzero,\" both \"stalkers\" who kill the \"running men.\" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the \"dancers of the future\" are none other than the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS \"80s.\" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as \"contestants.\" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.<br /><br />The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for \"national security\" is downright chilling. Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.<br /><br />The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the \"ravine\" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. \"Serious\" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their \"common man\" counterparts, such as this one.<br /><br />An absolute must-see.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine if it's positive or negative.

            "question": "Given the question statement:FORGET CREDIBILITY<br /><br />You must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when Renny Harlin is directing.<br /><br />\"CLIFFHANGER \" is no exception. But the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( Stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( Janine Turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass ) Good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film )\"It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\"<br /><br />If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Alright, I've got this text to analyze, and I need to determine whether the sentence is positive or negative. The sentence in question is: \"It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The text is a review of a movie called \"Cliffhanger,\" directed by Renny Harlin and starring Sylvester Stallone. The reviewer mentions that the movie has an endless string of unbelievable feats and that credibility is forgotten, which might be seen as a negative aspect. However, they also highlight several positive elements such as breathtaking scenery, stunning special effects, an excellent musical score, levity to relieve tension, and a solid cast.\n\nThe reviewer seems to appreciate these aspects and describes the movie as \"good, solid entertainment.\" They also reference Roger Ebert's comment about another film, which suggests that as long as you don't think too much, you can enjoy it.\n\nSo, the sentence in question is essentially saying that the movie is enjoyable if you don't overanalyze it or think too much about its credibility or plausibility. In other words, it's a fun, entertaining movie that doesn't require deep thought or suspension of disbelief beyond its inherent nature.\n\nNow, is this positive or negative? On one hand, it acknowledges that the movie isn't credible or realistic, which could be seen as a negative. On the other hand, it frames the movie as enjoyable precisely because you don't need to think too much, which seems to be a positive attribute for a action-packed entertainment film.\n\nGiven that the reviewer has already listed several positive aspects of the movie and calls it \"good, solid entertainment,\" it's likely that this sentence is meant to be positive. It's suggesting that the movie is easy to enjoy without getting bogged down by its flaws, which can be a compliment in the context of action movies where plot holes and unrealistic elements are often overlooked for the sake of entertainment.\n\nMoreover, the reviewer compares it favorably to other action movies, mentioning that it's no exception to the genre's tendencies but still stands out for its quality elements.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

The text is about a movie called \"The Last Wave\" directed by Peter Weir. The person who wrote this seems to have watched the film and is sharing their thoughts on it. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, they mention that it's Peter Weir's first international success, which sounds like a positive thing. Peter Weir is a respected director, so starting with international success is probably a good sign.\n\nNext, they describe the movie as \"a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.\" The word \"mainly effective\" suggests that it's mostly good at being a chiller, but maybe not perfect. \"Fascinating back story\" is definitely positive, showing that the writer found the background interesting.\n\nThen, they talk about Richard Chamberlain's performance, saying he gives a \"good performance.\" That's positive. The movie apparently deals with a defense lawyer getting involved in a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries, which sounds like an intriguing plot.\n\nDavid Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, and according to the writer, he tries to guide Chamberlain through the concept of 'Dreamtime,' which is central to native Australian culture. This suggests that the movie delves into cultural and supernatural elements, which might appeal to viewers interested in such themes.\n\nThe writer describes the film as \"heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting.\" Ambiguity can be a double-edged sword in movies. Some people enjoy ambiguous plots because they leave room for interpretation and can be more thought-provoking. Others might find it frustrating if they prefer clear storytelling. Here, the writer seems to accept the ambiguity as part of the film's style.\n\nThe film builds to an \"unsettling finale,\" which sounds appropriate for a chiller, suggesting that it achieves its goal of creating a sense of unease or horror. However, the writer mentions that this finale is \"somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.\" This is a negative point, indicating that the movie's ending isn't as effective as it could be because of lacking special effects.\n\nDespite this drawback, the writer concludes by calling it an \"intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.\" This suggests that, overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones, and the film leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

It says \"one of the hottest acts around\" and \"everyone wanted to see this movie.\" That sounds positive, right? People were excited about it.\n\nBut then it describes the movie as \"not much more than an extended music video.\" That might be neutral or slightly negative, suggesting that it doesn't have a lot of substance beyond the music.\n\nNext, it talks about the acting being \"pretty bad,\" which is clearly negative. But it excuses this by saying \"what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time?\" So, there's a bit of understanding there, softening the criticism.\n\nThen, it says \"despite that, it was still a very entertaining film!\" That's positive again. So, even with bad acting, the movie was enjoyable.\n\nMorris Day and Jerome Benton are highlighted for their comedy, compared to Abbott & Costello, which are legendary comedians. That's a positive comparison.\n\nThere's a mention of Appolina providing \"beautiful breasts\" and being \"very attractive,\" which might be positive in terms of physical appeal, but it's important to note that this is objectifying, and in modern context, such comments are inappropriate. However, in the context of the review, it seems to be mentioned as a positive aspect for some viewers.\n\nThe soundtrack is praised as \"one of the best Prince ever recorded,\" which is very positive.\n\nLater, there's a mention of Prince having a fallout with Warner Bros. and changing his name, but it says \"at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.\" That's positive.\n\nFinally, the movie doesn't rank \"in the all-time great category,\" which is a negative point, but it's still described as \"pretty entertaining.\" So, overall, it's enjoyable but not exceptional.\n\nExamples: \n                                In response to the ##Question, please output according to the following response format:\n                                # Example 1:\n\n                                ## Question:\n                                Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.

Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended music video. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all-time classic comedy, especially their rendition of \"The Password\", which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their \"who's on first\" baseball routine.<br /><br />Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. Plus, she is very attractive. And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.<br /><br />This movie doesn't rank in the all-time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.

            "output": "### Deep Thinking:\nAlright, I've got this text to analyze for sentiment, specifically whether it's positive or negative about the movie from 1984 featuring Prince. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that when the movie came out in 1984, Prince was extremely popular. It says \"one of the hottest acts around\" and \"everyone wanted to see this movie.\" That sounds positive, right? People were excited about it.\n\nBut then it describes the movie as \"not much more than an extended music video.\" That might be neutral or slightly negative, suggesting that it doesn't have a lot of substance beyond the music.\n\nNext, it talks about the acting being \"pretty bad,\" which is clearly negative. But it excuses this by saying \"what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time?\" So, there's a bit of understanding there, softening the criticism.\n\nThen, it says \"despite that, it was still a very entertaining film!\" That's positive again. So, even with bad acting, the movie was enjoyable.\n\nMorris Day and Jerome Benton are highlighted for their comedy, compared to Abbott & Costello, which are legendary comedians. That's a positive comparison.\n\nThere's a mention of Appolina providing \"beautiful breasts\" and being \"very attractive,\" which might be positive in terms of physical appeal, but it's important to note that this is objectifying, and in modern context, such comments are inappropriate. However, in the context of the review, it seems to be mentioned as a positive aspect for some viewers.\n\nThe soundtrack is praised as \"one of the best Prince ever recorded,\" which is very positive.\n\nLater, there's a mention of Prince having a fallout with Warner Bros. and changing his name, but it says \"at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.\" That's positive.\n\nFinally, the movie doesn't rank \"in the all-time great category,\" which is a negative point, but it's still described as \"pretty entertaining.\" So, overall, it's enjoyable but not exceptional.\n\n### Answer:\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1}.",
