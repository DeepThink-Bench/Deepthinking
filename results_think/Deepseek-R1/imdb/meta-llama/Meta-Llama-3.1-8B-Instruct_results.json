The use of humor here doesn't negate the positive sentiment.\n\nThey give a rating of 8/10, which is a solid score. They praise the choreography as superb and mention Lucille Ball's presence as making it more awesome. Both of these are additional positive points.\n\nNo negative aspects are mentioned.

The person starts by saying they saw the film and still wonder what the point was. That sounds negative because they're confused about the purpose, which isn't a good sign. Then they mention \"V.Dodgy camera moves\" in the courtyard that made them feel physically sick. The word \"dodgy\" implies poor quality, and feeling sick from the camera work is definitely a negative reaction. They also mention the camera moving \"Round and Round,\" which they found nauseating. \n\nNext, they comment on \"VERY VERY Strange accents\" and quote a line from the film: \"Those that should know, know.\" The repetition of \"VERY\" emphasizes their strong negative opinion about the accents, suggesting they found them off-putting or distracting. \n\nThe last part advises others to avoid the film unless they're getting in for free, being paid to watch it, or avoiding chores. This implies that the film isn't worth spending money or time on, which is a clear negative recommendation. \n\nLooking for any positive words, but there aren't any. The entire tone is critical.

Then it mentions that the movie is supposed to spoof 50s alien invasion films but is no better than them, except for technical aspects like makeup effects. Even though there's a mention of good makeup, the overall comparison is negative because the spoof is worse than the originals.

The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver.

The review starts by mentioning it's a below-average slasher film that isn't too memorable. That already sounds negative. The phrase \"below average\" is a clear indicator of a negative opinion.\n\nThen it says the movie has a \"made for TV feel,\" which might imply it's low budget or not cinematic. The reviewer also criticizes the score, pointing out the corny theme song. They mention specific lines of dialogue that fit into standard slasher screenplays, which could be seen as unoriginal. \n\nThere's a comment about the characters' friendship developing too quickly, which suggests poor character development. The reviewer also notes that the movie might not be made today due to the focus on a 15-year-old with gratuitous close-ups, hinting at possible exploitation or poor taste. \n\nThe social commentary on Native Americans is described as underdeveloped, so that's another negative point. The reviewer expresses surprise at the high rating the movie gets, indicating they think it's overrated. They compare it to another film, \"Bloody Birthday,\" saying both failed to deliver on their potential for carnage, which is another criticism. \n\nHowever, the last sentence mentions a bright side: releasing obscure movies on DVD gives hope for others.

In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher.' Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)<br /><br />The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.<br /><br />It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.<br /><br />Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.<br /><br />The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.<br /><br />I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.<br /><br />www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the given text about the movie \"Ecstasy\" (1933) starring Hedy Lamarr is positive or negative. The instructions say that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1; if negative, it's 0.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the entire review carefully to understand the sentiment. The text is a movie review, so I should look for adjectives and phrases that indicate the reviewer's opinion. Let's break it down paragraph by paragraph.\n\nThe first paragraph starts by calling the film a \"1930's treasure\" and mentions Hedy Lamarr as \"the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.\" Words like \"treasure,\" \"legendary career,\" and \"glorious introduction\" are all positive. The tone here is definitely complimentary.\n\nIn the second paragraph, the reviewer describes the director's techniques with phrases like \"gorgeous camera angles\" and \"pristine shot framing.\" They also mention that Lamarr's performance captures the audience's sympathy and support. Even though the film was considered shocking, the reviewer is highlighting the artistic aspects positively.\n\nThe third paragraph talks about the famous nude scene, noting it was \"legendarily scandalous\" but also mentions that audiences couldn't stay away, comparing it to today's movies where controversy drives viewership. While the scene was controversial, the reviewer frames it as a reason the film became a must-see, which is a positive angle.\n\nThe fourth paragraph discusses the romantic scenes, calling them \"beautiful work\" and \"delightful moment.\" Even though there's controversy, the director's skill is praised. The use of \"supremely well done\" in the fifth paragraph reinforces the positive sentiment towards the filmmaking.\n\nThe final paragraph strongly recommends the film, calling it \"memorable early treasure\" and noting that the story is compelling with direction ahead of its time. The reviewer urges readers to seek out the restored version, which is a clear endorsement.\n\nThroughout the review, even when discussing controversial aspects, the language is positive. Words like \"brave,\" \"worldwide fame,\" \"highly recommend,\" and \"worthwhile\" all indicate a favorable opinion. The reviewer acknowledges the film's historical significance and artistic merits despite its controversial elements. There's no negative criticism of the film itself; instead, the controversy is presented as a factor that added to its allure without detracting from its quality.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The multiple exclamation points emphasize their frustration or dislike.\n\nNext, they mention, \"I'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie.\" The word \"glad\" here is positive, but in context, it's expressing relief that the creators haven't produced more films, which is a negative reflection on their previous work. So the positivity here is actually a negative sentiment towards the filmmakers.\n\nThen, \"All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote.\" This suggests the filmmakers are compromising their original vision, which the reviewer sees as a negative trait, implying lack of integrity or dedication to quality.\n\n\"They keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching.\" Again, this points to inconsistency and pandering, which are negative criticisms of the filmmaking process.\n\nThe reviewer also says, \"I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year's Toronto Film Festival.\" The phrase \"could not get out fast enough\" is a strong indicator of dislike and a desire to leave, which is clearly negative.\n\nFinally, \"Please never see this film.\" A direct plea to others to avoid the film, which is a definitive negative recommendation.\n\nPutting it all together, every part of the review expresses strong negative opinions.

The main actors are Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur, and Charles Bickford. The director is Cecil B. DeMille, and this was his first collaboration with Gary Cooper.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a \"I trust only myself\" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />He meets his match in Skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a so-called law man named Gannon (John McIntyre) who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the \"Gold Rush\" Jefferson \"Soapy\" Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for Gannon's profit). <br /><br />Stewart is partner with Ben (Walter Brennan - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean). They are also joined by Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvert). Rhonda works closely with Gannon, but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However, she has a similar \"I only trust myself\" attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He, Ben, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson, Jeff opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach Dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to Rhonda, and Jeff, Ben, Rube, and Renee start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of Dawson. One led by Connie Gilchrist and Chubby Johnson want to build a decent town. But the Mounties won't be setting up a station in Dawson for months. The other, centering around the \"dancehall\" run by Rhonda, are in cahoots with Gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (Robert J. Wilke - really scary in one sequence with Chubby Johnson and Jay C. Flippen, Jack Elam, and Harry Morgan). Jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and Ben for a ranch they want in Utah. But will they get there? And will Jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />The performances are dandy here, including Stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. Brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. Flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab Stewart in the heart using Stewart's own words against him. McIntyre would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing Ward Bond, but his work in Mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And Calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier \"Gigi\" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Being a genre film fan, a child of the 80's AND a fan of hard rock music...this movie holds a special place in my heart. It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack. It certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. I didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) DVD release in 2002. If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare. You'll never look at your stereo the same way again. Or should I say MP3 player?<br /><br />TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played geeky Skippy Handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'Family Ties.' After a string of direct to video flops including, 'Little Devils''Killer Tomatoes eat France' and 'The Rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. Recently, he has been considering a TV comeback.<br /><br />Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer/ screenwriter. He has written and produced several major films and TV series, including: 'Space: Above and Beyond''The X-Files''Final Destination''Jet Li's The One''Willard' and most recently 'Final Destination 3'.<br /><br />Tony Fields (Sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the TV series 'Solid Gold'. He appeared in several low budget films and TV shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish Sammi Curr in 'Trick or Treat'. Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.<br /><br />Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething Matt Fielding on the popular sitcom 'Melrose Place'. Since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and TV series as: 'The One''Godzilla''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' and the short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series 'Firefly'. Currently he can be seen as Tom Scavo on the smash hit series 'Desperate Housewives'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the given text expresses a positive sentiment. The answer should be 1 for positive or 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The author starts by saying the movie holds a special place in their heart because they're a genre film fan, an 80's child, and a hard rock fan. That sounds positive. They mention the movie has everything you could want: action, great special effects for 1986, and a glam-rock soundtrack. All positive points. They also note it was THE movie for heavy metal fans at the time, which is a strong endorsement.\n\nThe next part says they didn't see it in the cinema because it wasn't released there, but its popularity on video led to a cult status. Even though the DVD release in 2002 was mediocre, the fact that it gained cult status is a positive aspect. Then the author advises that if you're not into creepy movies or rock, it might not be for you, but there are worse films of this type. They acknowledge average acting and ridiculous situations but still say it's a \"wailing riff above the usual horror fare.\" That metaphor using music terms reinforces a positive view. The ending about never looking at your stereo the same way again adds to the positive impact.\n\nThe trivia sections don't affect the sentiment much, just providing background on the actors. The main review is definitely positive despite some minor criticisms. The author clearly likes the movie and recommends it to fans of the genre.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. More faithful to the book than most movies of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling \"feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given sentence is positive (1) or negative (0). The user mentioned that if the sentiment is positive, the answer is 1, otherwise 0.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again to understand the overall tone. The review starts with a warning about spoilers and then mentions \"Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.\" That sounds negative. They say Fontaine is great, which is a positive point, but others, especially Richard Ney, are \"exceedingly wooden,\" which is another negative. The description of Ney lying in bed with every hair in place despite dying might be pointing out the unrealistic acting or lack of authenticity, so that's probably a negative comment.\n\nThen the reviewer says the movie is \"juicy and so suspenseful,\" which are positive adjectives. They also mention it's more faithful to the book than most movies of its era, which is a plus. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner and adulteress is called a \"masterful stroke,\" which is definitely a strong positive. The reviewer also notes that she's her usual self, which might be a compliment if they like her usual performances. The mention of her death scene seems to reference how murderers were portrayed, but I'm not sure if that's a positive or negative point here.\n\nSo, there's a mix of positives and negatives. The key is to determine the overall sentiment. The first part has several negatives (corny plot, terrible acting, wooden performances), but then there are positives (juicy, suspenseful, faithful adaptation, masterful casting). The reviewer seems to balance criticism with praise. However, the question is whether the sentence is positive or negative. \n\nIn some cases, even if there are negatives, if the overall recommendation is positive, it might still be 1. But here, the negatives are pretty strong. The reviewer points out significant flaws but also highlights some strengths. However, the last part about the casting being a masterful stroke and the movie being suspenseful and faithful might tip the balance towards a positive sentiment. But I need to check if the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when a review has both, the overall could be mixed, but the user is asking to classify it as either 1 or 0. The presence of \"so juicy and so suspenseful\" and \"masterful stroke\" might make the overall sentiment positive despite the negatives. The reviewer seems to enjoy the movie despite its flaws, which is a common way people review films. So maybe the answer is 1. But I need to be careful. Let me check again.\n\nThe first sentence: \"Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.\" That's a strong negative. Then \"Fontaine is great\" positive. \"others...exceedingly wooden\" negative. Then \"movie is so juicy and so suspenseful\" positive. \"More faithful to the book\" positive. \"Casting Joan Fontaine...masterful stroke\" positive. \"She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self\" \u2013 if that's a compliment, positive. The death scene description is neutral or maybe a factual statement.\n\nSo the positives are: Fontaine's performance, movie is juicy/suspenseful, faithful adaptation, masterful casting. The negatives: corny plot, terrible acting (except Fontaine), wooden performances (especially Ney). \n\nThe reviewer seems to acknowledge the flaws but still finds the movie enjoyable and effective. In such cases, the overall sentiment might still be positive. For example, \"Despite its flaws, the movie is a must-watch because...\" So maybe the answer is 1. But I'm a bit torn because the negatives are quite prominent. However, the positives are also strong. Let me think again. The user's instruction is to decide if the sentence is positive (1) or negative (0). The presence of both positive and negative elements complicates things. But in reviews, if the positives are highlighted as making the movie worth watching despite the negatives, it's usually considered positive. The reviewer says \"the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful\" which are strong positives.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Let's summarize the thoughts:\n\n* The review starts with a warning and mentions \"Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting,\" which are strong negatives.\n* However, the reviewer praises Fontaine's performance, the movie's suspensefulness, faithfulness to the book, and the masterful casting of Fontaine as a poisoner.\n* The reviewer seems to enjoy the movie despite its flaws, which is a common way people review films.\n* The positives are highlighted as making the movie worth watching, despite the negatives.\n\nConsidering these points, the overall sentiment of the review is positive, despite the presence of negatives.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like \"Tarzan\" and \"The Emperor's New Groove\" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. \"Atlantis\" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of \"The Little Mermaid\" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clich\u00e9d Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clich\u00e9d as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, \"The Little Mermaid\" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clich\u00e9d film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths \u0096 a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clich\u00e9s, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale \u0096 need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone \u0096 I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.<br /><br />But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent \"Titan A.E.\" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, \"Nadia\", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.<br /><br />With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clich\u00e9d tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).<br /><br />This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film \u0096 after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to determine if the given review of the movie \"Atlantis\" is positive or negative. The instructions say that if the review is positive, the answer is 1; if negative, it's 0.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the review carefully and look for clues indicating the author's overall sentiment. Let me start by summarizing the key points made in the text.\n\nThe review starts by mentioning Disney's shift towards diversity and more serious themes, using \"Atlantis\" as an example. The author notes that \"Atlantis\" is Disney's first serious animated film, which is a major achievement. However, they also mention that families might have been scared off due to its PG rating. \n\nNext, the reviewer discusses the plot, pointing out that it's condensed into 96 minutes, leading to some rushed sequences. They advise viewers to suspend disbelief about how quickly things happen. The comparison to \"Titanic\" is made, but the reviewer seems okay with the trade-off for an action-focused film.\n\nThe love story between the main characters is described as less clich\u00e9d than expected, which the reviewer sees as a positive. They acknowledge the use of clich\u00e9d characters but find the tongue-in-cheek approach amusing. The visuals and sound are highly praised, with specific compliments to the CGI, anime-inspired designs, and the soundtrack. The reviewer also mentions that the mythology is more accurate compared to other Disney films like \"Hercules.\"\n\nThe conclusion states it's a 10 out of 10 review, and the author was \"blown away\" by the film. They recommend viewers enjoy it despite some clich\u00e9s, focusing on the adventure and visuals.\n\nLooking at the language used, there are several positive indicators: \"boldest step yet,\" \"major achievement,\" \"stunning visuals,\" \"amazing CGI,\" \"dynamic musical score,\" and the final 10/10 rating. Even when discussing negatives like clich\u00e9s or rushed plot, the reviewer downplays them as acceptable or even enjoyable in context. The overall tone is enthusiastic and approving, despite acknowledging some flaws.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given sentence is positive or negative. The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Repugnant Bronson thriller.\" The word \"repugnant\" is a strong negative adjective meaning disgusting or offensive. So right off the bat, the reviewer is expressing a strong dislike. Then they mention it's a \"Bronson thriller,\" which refers to Charles Bronson, known for action films, maybe like the Death Wish series. But the key here is the adjective \"repugnant\" setting a negative tone.\n\nNext, \"Unfortunately, it's technically good...\" The word \"unfortunately\" here is interesting. It suggests that despite the technical quality (like cinematography, acting, direction), the reviewer is conflicted. They acknowledge the technical aspects are good, but there's a \"but\" coming. The fact that they use \"unfortunately\" implies that the technical merits don't outweigh the negative aspects for them.\n\nThen, \"and I gave it 4/10...\" A 4 out of 10 is a low score. Typically, a 5 might be average, so 4 is below average. This reinforces the negative sentiment. Even though they said it's technically good, the overall score is still low, which might mean the other factors (like the content being vile) drag it down significantly.\n\nContinuing, \"but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it 'entertainment'.\" The word \"vile\" is another strong negative term, even stronger than \"repugnant.\" The reviewer is emphasizing how morally despicable or offensive the content is. They can't even consider it entertainment, which is a key point. Usually, even if a movie is bad, people might still find it entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way, but here the reviewer is saying it's beyond that\u2014it's not entertaining at all because of how vile it is.\n\nLastly, \"Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.\" Comparing it to slasher films, which are known for their violence and gore, the reviewer is saying this is even more disturbing. Slasher films can be seen as entertaining for horror fans, but this one crosses a line into being too disturbing. This adds to the negative sentiment because it's not just violent; it's excessively so, making it unenjoyable.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n1. The reviewer starts with a strong negative adjective (\"repugnant\") to describe the movie.\n2.

It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris!

The author starts by expressing confusion about why Godard is taken seriously, calling the film an example of his ineptitude as a filmmaker and intellectual. They mention Marxist and Maoist ideas as \"kant\" (probably a typo for \"cant,\" meaning insincere talk) and criticize those ideologies for being destructive.\n\nThe author then mocks Godard's filmmaking techniques, like using multiple boring voice-overs and the inclusion of the Rolling Stones just to get the film seen. They also criticize specific scenes, like the bookshop scene, calling it worse than fringe theatre and insulting to children. The text contrasts Godard with Truffaut, praising Truffaut's film about filmmaking while calling Godard's the worst. Finally, they mention that Godard didn't even choose the Stones' track used, implying a lack of intentionality.\n\nThroughout the text, the language is harsh and derogatory. Words like \"ineptitude,\" \"tedious political diatribes,\" \"mindless rubbish,\" \"talentless,\" \"arrogant contempt,\" and \"poverty of intellect\" all indicate a strongly negative opinion. The author doesn't have anything positive to say about Godard or the film. Even when mentioning the Rolling Stones, it's to belittle Godard's reliance on their fame.

The recommendation to watch the movie and think about current soldiers in Afghanistan reinforces a positive message, encouraging empathy and awareness.\n\nThe part about basic training and drill sergeants not being \"morning people\" and needing \"sensitivity training\" is followed by \"HA!HA!HA!\" which seems like a humorous aside. Even though they joke about the drill sergeants, it's not a criticism of the movie itself but a light-hearted comment on military life. The overall sentiment here is still positive towards the movie.\n\nLooking for any negative cues: The user doesn't mention anything bad about the movie. All the points made are about what the movie did well\u2014casting, focus on real people, emotional depth. The contrast with Hollywood overhype is a critique of other movies, not this one. The humor about drill sergeants is a personal anecdote, not a negative point about the film.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the \"southern\" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \"Faith\". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston.

The author starts by calling the movie a \"more horrifying misrepresentation\" than they imagined. That's a strong negative statement. They mention terrible acting and dismiss any defense that it was intentional. The musical score is compared to \"Rockford Files,\" which I think is a TV show, so maybe implying it's not fitting for the movie's tone.\n\nThe reviewer expected a pleasant experience but found the portrayal of southern characters fraudulent, criticizing the accents and the comedic take on their faith. They say the ending lacked character sentiment and failed where the book succeeded. Even the policemen characters are mocked as inauthentic. The only positive note is Ned Beatty's performance, but that's a single point in an otherwise negative review.\n\nThe reviewer mentions that the film is a \"shameful mockery\" of the author's intentions, which they and other fans understand. They even say they would have thrown the movie away if they saw it as Huston did. They end by forgiving Huston but say forgetting will take time, which still sounds negative overall.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.<br /><br />RDA gives his 'O'Neill' character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.<br /><br />There is a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. The episode 'Solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.<br /><br />'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet 'O'Neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.<br /><br />The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.<br /><br />The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.<br /><br />There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.<br /><br />I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener, 'Daniel Jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. Frasier'.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given text is positive or negative. The user says that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and if it's negative, it's 0.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying they enjoyed the show for two main reasons: Richard Dean Anderson (RDA) and Amanda Tapping. They mention that these two carried the show with support from others. But then they talk about seasons 9-10 where RDA was replaced, which took the heart out of the show. So that part is negative.\n\nThey praise the chemistry between the main characters, saying the actors seem to get along well, which adds to the show. Positive point. They also highlight RDA's portrayal of O'Neill, making the character believable with his wisecracks. The interaction between Carter and O'Neill, especially in the episode \"Solitudes,\" is mentioned as having great drama and love that made facing death bearable. More positive aspects.\n\nHowever, they criticize seasons 9 and 10 again, saying the quality declined, the story arc was used up, new villains weren't interesting, and Ben Browder wasn't as good as RDA. Amanda Tapping's performance is said to be phoned in, possibly due to her having a baby. Negative points here.\n\nThe spin-off Stargate Atlantis is called weaker, with poor chemistry among characters and villains (Wraiths) being ludicrous. They also mention issues with special effects, like pyramid-shaped spaceships and torches for illumination, which they find campy and hard to accept. Continuity errors are pointed out, like the sarcophagus healing uniforms and plot devices not being reused. These are all negative points.\n\nSo, the text has both positive and negative elements. The user starts by saying they enjoyed the show for specific reasons but then lists several criticisms. The question is whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The user's initial positive comments are strong, but the majority of the text focuses on the negatives, especially the decline in later seasons, spin-off issues, and technical flaws. However, the user does express appreciation for the original cast and their chemistry. But the final sentence asks if the given sentence is positive. Wait, the user might be referring to the entire text. Since the text starts with positive points but has more negative points, especially in the latter half, the overall sentiment might be mixed. But the user's main enjoyment is from the first two actors, but the replacement and later seasons are negative. However, the question is whether the text is positive or negative. In such cases, if there's a mix, but the majority is negative, it might be 0. But the user starts by saying they enjoyed the show, so maybe the overall is positive. Wait, but the user also says the quality declined, spin-off is weak, effects are bad, continuity issues. So maybe the overall is negative. But the initial part is positive. Hmm. The user's main point is that they enjoyed the show for the original cast, but the later parts made it worse. So the overall sentiment might be positive because they did enjoy parts of it, but the majority of the text is pointing out negatives. However, the user's own statement is that they enjoyed it for two reasons. But the rest is criticism. So maybe the overall is positive but with criticisms. But the question is whether the sentence (the entire text) is positive. If the user starts with positive but then lists many negatives, the overall could be negative. Alternatively, the user's main point is that they liked the show because of the original cast, but later seasons ruined it. So maybe the overall is mixed but leans negative. However, the instructions say if the sentence is positive, answer 1, else 0. The user's first statement is positive, but the rest is negative. But the entire text is a mix. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative aspects, it depends on the overall balance. Here, the user starts with positives but spends more time on negatives. So maybe the overall sentiment is negative. Therefore, the answer would be 0. But I need to check again. The user says \"I enjoyed this show for two reasons...\" which is positive. Then they list positives and negatives. But the majority of the text is negative. So maybe the overall is negative. But the user did enjoy the show. Wait, maybe the user is giving a review that's mixed but overall positive because they liked the original parts. But the replacement and later seasons made it worse. But the user still enjoyed the show for the original reasons. However, the question is about the entire text.

The plot is described as the \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids,\" which they note is familiar to those who've seen it before. The reviewer says that people who've seen it before will probably watch it again, but warns that if you're expecting something highbrow like Ingmar Bergman, you'll be disappointed and should skip it. They mention Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and actors like David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, and Katherine Heigl as \"eye candy,\" advising to \"go with the flow and enjoy it.\" The reviewer also loved the creepy mask.\n\nNow, breaking this down. The reviewer points out that the plot is clich\u00e9d, which could be a negative. However, they also say that fans of the genre might rewatch it, which suggests it's enjoyable for its target audience. The mention of Marilyn Manson and the actors as eye candy could be seen as positives for a certain crowd.

The positive comment about the mask adds to the positives.\n\nBut there's a mix here. The comparison to Bergman is a negative, but the reviewer is telling people who expect that to skip it, implying that if you know what you're getting into (a fun, maybe campy horror), you'll like it. The overall tone seems to be that it's a typical genre film with some enjoyable elements, so the sentiment might lean positive despite some criticisms.

They mention it's a must-see for fans of 70's rock, which is a recommendation. The part in parentheses is a joke about not wanting to be like the band in twenty years, but that's probably just humor, not negative.\n\nNext paragraph praises Bill Nighy's performance as \"excellent\" and mentions his role as the lead singer trying to recapture old spirit. Positive again. Then Stephen Rea's role is described as the glue holding the band together but not succeeding well. Even though the character isn't succeeding, that's part of the movie's plot, not a negative critique of the movie itself. The reviewer is just describing the character's role.\n\nThe last part says if you love music or were in a band, the movie is definitely for you, and you won't regret seeing it.

            "question": "Given the question statement:This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a caf\u00e9 in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam's is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam's. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers. But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon SorbonneIf you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the sentiment of this film review is positive or negative. The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again to get a good understanding. The review describes a film that reimagines Romeo and Juliet in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the added layer of the main characters being gay. The setting is very bleak, with constant war, bombings, and a lot of tragedy. The lovers, Noam and Ashraf, face conflicts not just from their opposing communities but also from their own cultures regarding their sexuality. The story escalates with a bombing, retaliation, and ultimately both lovers die in a suicide bomb attack. The review also mentions a play within the film depicting gay love in Auschwitz, which is described as \"strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking.\" \n\nThe author, Dr. Coulardeau, concludes that the film is a denunciation of the ongoing conflict in Palestine, suggesting that love is impossible there. He criticizes historical decisions (like Britain's handling of the region) and current approaches to peace, which he sees as inadequate. The final lines are quite cynical, stating that love is an \"extra-terrestrial concept\" in this context, while sex is just for procreating soldiers.\n\nNow, to determine the sentiment. The key points here are the themes of the film: tragic love, war, societal rejection, and political conflict. The reviewer uses words like \"bleak,\" \"impossible love,\" \"denunciation,\" \"suffering will go on,\" and \"love is forbidden.\" These are all negative descriptors. However, the reviewer also calls the film's depiction \"strikingly strong\" and \"breathtakingly shocking,\" which might indicate admiration for the film's boldness or impact. \n\nBut the overall tone of the review seems to focus on the harsh realities and the critique of the political situation. The reviewer's conclusion is that the film highlights the impossibility of love and the futility of the conflict, which are negative themes. Even though the reviewer might appreciate the film's message or artistic approach, the content they're describing is overwhelmingly tragic and critical. \n\nIn academic reviews, even if a film is well-made, if it's depicting a negative scenario and the review emphasizes that negativity in its analysis, the sentiment would still be considered negative. The positive adjectives here (\"strong,\" \"shocking\") are about the film's effectiveness in conveying its message, not necessarily a positive sentiment towards the subject matter. The reviewer's own stance seems to align with the film's critical view of the conflict, which is a negative perspective on the real-world situation.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (the Marx Brothers' nemesis in _Night In Casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _Night At The Opera_), playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their \"usual\" characters would do.<br /><br />It also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could be not so much a \"straight\" romantic comedy, as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional, stock characters.<br /><br />I've seen it only once, with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers \"see\" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I'm assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the sentiment of the given text is positive or negative. The user wants to know if the answer should be 1 (positive) or 0 (negative). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The author starts by saying that on the surface, the movie is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. But beneath that, it's MGM's character actor stunt-casting at its funniest. The mention of \"above-average\" already sounds positive, and \"stunt-casting at its funniest\" suggests they found the casting choices really amusing.\n\nThen the author talks about the leads being straightforward, but the secondary characters are cast against type. They list actors known for specific roles (like the Wicked Witch of the West, a fussbudget, and a Marx Brothers nemesis) playing against their usual characters. The fact that they're playing well-intentioned characters trying to bring the leads together instead of driving them apart is highlighted. The author seems to appreciate this twist, which adds humor and subverts expectations. \n\nNext, the text mentions the movie pokes fun at romantic-comedy conventions, suggesting it's a send-up rather than a straight romantic comedy. The author thinks this is a sign that the movie is wryly mocking the genre's stock characters. That could be seen as a positive aspect if the satire is well-executed.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions they've only seen the movie once with interruptions, so they can't be entirely sure. They speculate that the movie might have worked better in its original context when the secondary characters were more familiar to the audience. Now, viewers might see those characters differently, which could affect the movie's effectiveness. Despite this uncertainty, the author gives it 9 stars and found it hysterical. \n\nEven though there's some doubt about how well the movie holds up today, the overall tone is positive. The author rates it highly and uses words like \"hysterical,\" which is a strong positive indicator. The criticisms are more about the context changing over time rather than the movie's quality itself. So, even with those caveats, the sentiment is still positive.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material. However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The instructions say if it's positive, answer 1; if negative, 0.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The review starts by summarizing the plot, but mentions there's no real plot backing it up. Then it compares the movie to other PM films, which are described as cheap action flicks with lots of explosions and little story. The reviewer says some PM titles are mildly enjoyable, but Cyber Tracker 2 isn't because of the lead actor, Don Wilson, who's called \"charisma-less.\" They also criticize the director for lacking flair compared to another director in similar movies. \n\nThe review points out that the movie rips off better films like Robocop and Terminator, and the supporting cast overacts except for Tony Burton. The only positives mentioned are that Stacie Foster could be better with better material, but overall, the movie is called noisy, bland, lackluster, and lacking in real martial arts sequences. The final rating is *1/2 out of 4, labeled as \"Poor.\"\n\nThe key negative points are the unoriginal plot, poor acting (especially the lead), lackluster direction, overacting supporting cast, and reliance on explosions without substance. The reviewer clearly doesn't recommend it and compares it unfavorably to other similar low-budget films. Even though there's a minor positive note about Tony Burton and Stacie Foster, the overwhelming tone is negative.

It stands out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of native American (or, more appropriately for its Canadian setting, \"First Nations\") culture and standing with \"Black Robe\" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject: Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (England) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the \"red indian\" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning<br /><br />Indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, by most accounts) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North, and this forms the focus of Attenborough's tale. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Grey Owl's wife Pony) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching.

The author also says it \"stands out as a genre film\" and praises its portrayal of First Nations culture, comparing it to \"Black Robe,\" which is another well-regarded film. \n\nThen it talks about the main subject, Archie \"Grey Owl\" Belaney. The description of his character includes some flaws\u2014vain, marrying and abandoning brides\u2014but notes that he was charming and became an advocate for protecting nature. The focus on his transformation into a writer and advocate is part of Attenborough's tale. The chemistry between the actors Brosnan and Annie Galipeau is described as \"engaging\" and \"touching,\" even if not fiery. The final line says it's \"a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd,\" which is a positive recommendation.\n\nThere are some neutral or mixed points, like mentioning Grey Owl's personal flaws, but the overall tone seems to highlight the film's strengths. The negative aspects of the character are presented as part of the story but don't reflect negatively on the film's quality. The reviewer uses words like \"compelling,\" \"well written,\" \"scrupulously accurate,\" and \"good film,\" which are all positive.

At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her. Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction. <br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex? <br /><br />These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else. <br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material. I'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe review starts by saying \"Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing.\" That's a strong negative statement. Then the user goes into the plot details, pointing out various subplots and characters, but criticizes the film for losing direction, not developing characters enough, and having too many subplots that aren't resolved. The reviewer also mentions that the directing style is pedestrian, like a soap opera, and calls the film a missed opportunity. They even note that the director's last film shows no visual style or storytelling ability. \n\nThe key points here are the negative adjectives and phrases: \"nothing worked,\" \"loses direction,\" \"no one story or character is fully developed,\" \"big mistake,\" \"pedestrian directing style,\" \"huge missed opportunity,\" \"no evidence of a visual style,\" etc. All of these are clear indicators of a negative review. The reviewer is pointing out multiple flaws without any redeeming qualities mentioned. Even though they mention some actors trying their best, like Jorja Fox, it's framed as her effort being in spite of the poor material.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon \"retellings\", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clich\u00e9d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the given text expresses a positive sentiment (1) or a negative one (0). The text is a review of a movie, specifically a remake or retelling of \"Prom Night.\" \n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully to understand the overall tone. The author starts by saying they're not fond of remakes, which already sets a negative tone. They mention that the original wasn't a masterpiece but still succeeded as horror. Then they list several criticisms: lack of suspense, cheap scares, poorly executed clich\u00e9s, unlikable characters, and frustration with characters making illogical decisions. \n\nThe reviewer uses phrases like \"peeved me off,\" \"cheap scares,\" \"couldn't successfully pull that off,\" \"doesn't have one\" (referring to a likable hero), and \"clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed.\" All of these are strong indicators of a negative sentiment. They even compare the remake unfavorably to the original, pointing out where it fails to meet basic horror genre conventions.\n\nThere's a mention of the head detective being a character they identified with, but that's presented as a contrast to the main characters, which the reviewer finds lacking. The examples given about characters making poor decisions (like jogging instead of sprinting away from a killer) further emphasize the negative critique.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

A lot of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all that. It was fun, colourful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more lighthearted.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Normally, I don't care a lot for musical and dance movies, but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was awesome.<br /><br />ANNETTE: That's really saying a lot coming from Travis. I can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were. You can tell, for example, that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection.<br /><br />TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really do a good villain. That one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back...AWESOME. And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she got killed). She can sing too! Kudos to the casting department on their choices there. I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho. He was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste. (I kept wishing Bill Sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene.) And they shouldn't have had him sing either.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Acting was truly superb. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny, and at the same time lightly sinister too. The supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe carried his Mr. Bumble role extremely well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another movie entitled \"Davy\" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been in a lot more movies.<br /><br />TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book, but IMO it was more robust. This movie was not boring either, as some musicals seem to be. And the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters. The tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long.<br /><br />ANNETTE: Any musical movie which Travis watches completely has to be a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy-to-watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end. In a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude.<br /><br />Our combined rating for this was 8.5 of 10. (We'll round up to 9 in this case.).<br /><br />TRAVIS: I rated this a 7 mainly because the Oliver Twist kid (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding movie.<br /><br />ANNETTE: My rating is a 10. Movies don't get much better than this. And you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was...a masterpiece.<br /><br />Please don't miss this one...even if you normally don't like musicals.

Their combined rating is 8.5, rounded up to 9. \n\nEven though there are some negative comments about the Oliver Twist character, the majority of the review is positive.

The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it.

It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with.

There are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. <br /><br />The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences).

The user says if the sentiment is positive, answer 1; if negative, 0.\n\nFirst, the review starts by calling it \"probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.\" Wait, Ed Wood is known for making really bad, campy movies. So comparing it to Ed Wood might be a joke, implying it's so bad it's good. The reviewer might be sarcastic here.\n\nThen they mention they can't spoil the ending because they don't understand what happened. That sounds like the plot is confusing or nonsensical. They talk about lesbian vampires swapping bodies, no plot, no character development, random characters appearing and disappearing. All of these points are usually negatives in a serious review, but the tone here seems more amused than annoyed.\n\nThe reviewer mentions zombies possibly being enemies of vampires but also a dream-within-a-dream sequence in a mental hospital, suggesting it's all a hallucination. Again, this adds to the confusion, but the reviewer is pointing it out in a humorous way.\n\nThe \"upside\" they list includes the lead girls taking their shirts off, which is a positive for some viewers, but maybe mentioned in a cheeky way. The special effects are called \"mind-boggling,\" but they liked the slow, awkward fight sequences. \"Mind-boggling\" could be negative, but paired with liking the awkwardness, it's probably a positive in a so-bad-it's-good context. The Canadian accents adding hilarity also suggest it's funny because it's bad.\n\nThey end by saying it's \"well worth the price of rental\" and that they laughed until they cried.

It's brilliant! It stays almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. How many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? Vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected.

The reviewer mentions that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s portrayal of Brashear shows leadership by example, which is another positive point.\n\nThe text goes on to describe the challenges Brashear faced in the Navy, but the focus is on his determination and the inspiring nature of overcoming those obstacles. The mention of Robert DeNiro's character having some prejudices but also being a hero who can inspire suggests a complex but ultimately positive dynamic between the two main characters. The reviewer highlights the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding as the best thing about the movie, which is a strong positive statement.\n\nAdditionally, other performances by Charlize Theron and Hal Holbrook are noted as good, which adds to the positive aspects of the review. The conclusion calls the movie an \"inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change,\" which clearly indicates a positive recommendation.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The user mentioned that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and negative is 0.

Then they mention being a bright guy but it was too much for a tired brain, which again is a complaint about the movie being hard to follow. They suggest it needs early clues about the characters and plot, implying confusion. Also, they say it's \"probably better for the US market,\" which might mean it's not appealing to them personally. The mention of \"GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why\" suggests the movie wasn't Oscar-worthy, which is a negative point.\n\nNext, there are some positive comments: \"the sand dunes are pretty,\" \"the cricket is good to see,\" and a compliment about George's appearance. But these are mixed with negative remarks like \"nail pulling is nasty\" and \"attorneys drunk dad is a mystery.\" The person also compares it unfavorably to \"Walk the Line,\" which they found much better even though they don't like Johnny Cash. They mention struggling to write ten lines about it despite the movie being long, which shows they didn't have much to say positively. The closing lines about their wife's comment and asking \"am I nearly there yet?\" and \"How about now\" might indicate impatience or frustration.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as \"Pardon My Terror.\") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! \"Who Done It?\" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The review is about the Three Stooges film \"Who Done It?\" The author starts by saying it has \"many surefire laughs and gags,\" which sounds positive. Then they state it's \"not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced.\" That's a strong endorsement. \n\nThe next part talks about the film's history, originally written for the Stooges but adapted for another team when Curly Howard had a stroke. But then it was finally made by the Stooges in 1947. This background info doesn't seem negative; just factual. \n\nThe plot summary mentions the Stooges as detectives trying to solve a mystery. The reviewer says Shemp is \"particularly funny\" with specific examples of his scenes, like reacting to a mickey and the actress trying not to laugh. They also highlight other funny scenes, like Moe looking through the camera and a fight in the dark. \n\nThey mention a goon character as \"unusual looking\" but in a way that's interesting, not negative. The conclusion calls the film a \"gem\" and a \"true Stooge classic,\" giving it a 9 out of 10. Even die-hard Curly fans are said to enjoy it, which is a positive note since Curly is a beloved member.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The user wants me to determine if the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The text is a review of a film featuring Christopher Lee.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again carefully. The user starts by saying they have a fondness for Christopher Lee, which is positive, but then says the film wasn't up to his other performances. Even though Lee is praised as one of the better actors, the main point here is that the film didn't meet expectations.\n\nNext, the review mentions the film doesn't live up to its premise, isn't scary, is overly melodramatic, and drags. The repetition of \"draaaaaags\" emphasizes that the pacing was slow and tedious. The writer kept expecting a good part that never came, which shows disappointment.\n\nThen, the Evil Ones (probably the antagonists) aren't convincing, and other characters lack depth. That's a negative point about the film's character development. \n\nThe reviewer also mentions considering MSTie-fication, which I think refers to Mystery Science Theater-style mocking, but even that didn't seem worth the effort. The final verdict is that the film isn't very good or bad, just mediocre. Mediocre is definitely a negative assessment because it's not meeting even average expectations.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs, best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to determine if the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The text is a series of opinions about wrestling title holders and matches.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each part of the text to gauge the sentiment. The sentence starts with \"I didn't like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay.\" The phrase \"didn't like\" is clearly negative. However, the use of \"gay\" here is problematic. In some contexts, \"gay\" can be used derogatorily to mean something negative, which adds to the negative sentiment. So this part is negative.\n\nNext, \"Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ.\" The speaker is expressing dissatisfaction with Jeff Hardy being champion by calling him \"crappy,\" which is a strong negative term. The desire for Regal to regain the title also implies dissatisfaction with the current situation. Another negative point here.\n\nThen, \"Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it.\" The phrase \"too long already\" suggests impatience or frustration, indicating a negative view of Rob Van Dam's tenure. The speaker wants Brock to win instead, showing disapproval of the current champion. Another negative sentiment.\n\nThe next part says, \"I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs.\" Here, \"pleased\" is a positive term. This is a clear positive statement amidst the negatives. However, the following sentence is \"best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.\" The speaker is complimenting the match, which is positive. \n\nNow, I need to weigh the positive and negative parts. The text has two positive statements (pleased with Storm/Christian and best match) and three negative statements (The Rock, Jeff Hardy, Rob Van Dam). But the user's question is whether the entire sentence is positive or negative. Sentiment analysis often considers the overall balance. However, in some cases, even a mix can lean towards negative if there are more negative points. But the user's instruction might be to check if there's any positive sentiment. Wait, the question says, \"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0.\" So it's a binary choice based on overall sentiment.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

For some bizarre reason - and I only have myself to blame - I watched the whole thing, hoping that there would be *something* unique in the entire movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's \"Midas Touch\" with action flicks, he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.<br /><br />First, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he couldn't lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper. Having said that, Zane's performance falters about 2/ 3rds of the way through, as he doesn't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug. <br /><br />Can't blame him here, though. The writing, quite frankly, sucked. Let's take ideas from \"Rat Race,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Midnight Run\" and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it. And who's brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan, the \"man of the hour\" of \"The Next Action Star\" shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series. A one-note johnny, Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well, but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film. Quite frankly, we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid-way through, as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him. His dumb-but-lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I don't think so. I kept expecting her to quote Arnie. Her character \"performance\" can be compared only to the dramatic depths of \"Freddy Got Fingered,\" though not nearly as well-developed. The camera loves her in dark, shadowy limousines, but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast, but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. \"Next Action Star\" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell given Jeff Welch's lame script. Someone should take Welch's iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach, even for complete shlock like this. <br /><br />Joel Silver should be ashamed.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Joel Silver's \"Midas Touch\" reference is sarcastic, implying he failed. So definitely negative here.\n\nNext, Billy Zane is the only redeeming value, but even he couldn't save the bad writing. The writing \"sucked,\" rehashing ideas from other movies. Two bridge chase sequences in a row are criticized. More negativity towards the script and direction.\n\nThen, talking about Sean Carrigan, the lead from \"Next Action Star.\" The review says he's a one-note Johnny, struggles to carry the film, and the audience doesn't care if he lives or dies. His character isn't likable. That's negative.\n\nCorinne Van Ryck de Groot is called wooden and rigid, compared to Terminator but not in a good way. Her performance is worse than a minor character. Harsh criticism again.\n\nThe conclusion says Sean might work in an ensemble but not solo. The script is lame, Jeff Welch should be stopped, and Joel Silver should be ashamed.

The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.<br /><br />Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.<br /><br />The \"hobgoblins\" are, as you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her \"proud of him.\" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.<br /><br />And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film-making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood, Jr.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to determine if the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The instructions say that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and if negative, it's 0.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully. The author is talking about a movie, probably \"Hobgoblins,\" and their experience watching it either as the regular version or the MST3K version (which I know is Mystery Science Theater 3000, a show that makes fun of bad movies). The key here is to pick up on the emotional tone and the words used to describe the movie.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The user mentions being impressed by the \"utter GALL\" of the production. \"Gall\" usually means boldness or nerve, often in a negative sense. They say the filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence and don't care about it. That's clearly negative.\n\nNext paragraph: Everything is described as \"rock-bottom cheap,\" and even a car from the 1950s in a flashback looks like it's from a junkyard. The use of \"rock-bottom cheap\" is a strong negative descriptor. They're pointing out the low production value, which is a criticism.\n\nThird paragraph: The hobgoblins are made with badly-crafted puppets and stuffed toys. When someone is attacked, it's obvious the victim is holding the toy themselves. The camera angles are criticized for not showing the creatures scurrying away, comparing it to another film where they didn't show the wreckage. The sets are called \"laughable,\" Club Scum is just a diner, the house looks vacant, and the spacecraft model is worse than a child's. All these points are negative, highlighting poor production quality and lack of effort.\n\nFourth paragraph: The characters' motivations don't make sense. Kevin's girlfriend is a \"worthless ingrate,\" and their reconciliation is forced. The critique here is on bad writing and character development. Nick's portrayal of the military is negative, Kyle's character is criticized for being effeminate and a phone-sex freak, and the female characters are one-dimensional (prude vs. sleaze). All of these are negative comments about the script and acting.\n\nLast paragraph: The hobgoblins' actions at the end are confusing, and the author questions why they go back. The overall assessment is that the film is primitive film-making with an idiotic script, incompetent direction, terrible actors, and sets compared to Ed Wood (known for \"Plan 9 from Outer Space,\" a famously bad movie). The final line is a clear negative judgment.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The user provided a movie review and wants to determine if the sentence \"Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY.\" is positive (1) or negative (0). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context of the entire review. The reviewer starts by saying the movie doesn't deserve a full review, which already sounds negative. They mention potential but failure to meet it, comparing it to films like \"28 Days Later\" and \"Blair Witch Project,\" which are well-regarded. The first 20 minutes had some good elements but didn't fully capture the eerie atmosphere.\n\nThe characters are criticized, especially the heroine being called a \"worthless piece of crap,\" and the reviewer didn't care if she died. The main villain's reveal was disappointing, described as something a 10-year-old could beat. The overall assessment is that the movie is mediocre, following a Hollywood formula, and failed to hit the mark.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific sentence in question: the reviewer uses \"lame\" to describe the movie, which is clearly negative. They point out that the characters had multiple chances to defeat the villain but chose to run away instead. This is likely a critique of poor writing or lack of logic in the plot, making the movie seem weak or frustrating. The use of all caps in \"INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY\" emphasizes frustration or annoyance.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given text is positive or negative. The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the review again. The author starts by mentioning that \"House of Games\" is David Mamet's directorial debut and calls it an effective and surprising psychological thriller. They praise the performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, saying their performances are superb, even if they're described as \"showy and distracting.\" The reviewer also highlights the dialogue as a strong point, which is typical of Mamet's work, and mentions that the story is central, even if the direction is called dull and flat. \n\nThere are some negative points noted, like the direction being uninspiring. However, the overall tone seems to lean positive. The reviewer says it's an \"extremely enjoyable film experience\" and gives it a 9/10. The conclusion is that the film is satisfying and the ending is stunning.

That sounds positive. Then Susannah York is described as a \"good foil\" for O'Toole's presence. A foil usually means she complements him well, so that's another positive point.\n\nNext, the film is said to allude to incest without explicit scenes but still entertains with raucous social commentary. The reviewer mentions it's not a major film but will be remembered for entertaining performances. Even though it's not considered major, the fact that it's entertaining and memorable leans positive. \n\nThen Susannah York's performance at the end is again praised as a \"treat to watch\" and she exudes tragedy silently. More positive remarks. The weakness mentioned is Thompson's laid-back direction, which is a negative point. However, the reviewer says the film still \"floats because of the actors and the script,\" which implies that despite the direction, the positives outweigh the negatives. \n\nThe user also mentions seeing the film twice over 20 years, which suggests they liked it enough to watch it again.

            "question": "Given the question statement:I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to determine if the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The text is a review of the movie \"Julian Po.\" \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully.

They mention that Christian Slater is underrated and that supporting actors are better than what's shown here. That's a mixed point\u2014acknowledging potential but maybe not praising the film itself.\n\nNext, the reviewer notes the movie is based on a short story they haven't read, so they're unsure if the faults are from the source material or the adaptation. The premise is called wonderful, and the opening narration's tone is liked. But then the critique starts. The main issues are that after the setup, nothing happens. The characters ask Julian about his suicide intention, but he doesn't explain, which the reviewer finds unsatisfying. They feel Julian's character isn't developed beyond some basic info, and interactions with locals don't go anywhere. \n\nThe reviewer criticizes Julian as being condescending, selfish, and petty, especially in a scene where he humiliates a mechanic's wife. They also mention the director's attitude seems half-baked and contrived, and Michael Parks' talent is wasted. \n\nLooking at the overall tone, the reviewer starts with some positives but quickly shifts to pointing out flaws. The negatives are detailed and numerous, focusing on character development, plot progression, and direction. Words like \"half-baked,\" \"contrived,\" \"selfish,\" \"petty,\" and \"condescending\" are strong negatives.

The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again. It's about Billie Clark, who becomes a vigilante called Alley Cat after her life is ruined by a street gang. The story involves revenge, violence, her fighting off attackers with her martial arts skills, and her grandparents being killed. The text mentions an R rating for nudity and violence, and there's a comment at the end saying she should have been Catwoman in a Batman movie.\n\nNow, to determine the sentiment. The plot seems to be action-packed and focuses on revenge, which is common in action/adventure genres. The mention of a \"dramatic ending\" and calling her a \"martial arts queen\" and \"crack shot\" might be seen as positive descriptors. However, the content itself is quite violent and dark, with the protagonist's family being killed and her seeking vengeance. The R rating for nudity and violence could be a negative aspect depending on the audience's perspective. The last line is a positive opinion about the actress playing Catwoman, but that's more of a personal opinion rather than a review of the movie itself.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the sentence (the entire text) is positive or negative. The text is describing the movie's plot and elements. The tone here is more descriptive, but the content includes violent and revenge themes. However, in terms of the sentiment towards the movie, the author seems to highlight exciting elements (vigilante, martial arts, dramatic ending) and ends with a positive note about the actress. The P.S. is a compliment, suggesting the actress would be good as Catwoman. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because it's promoting the movie's exciting aspects and praising the actress. But the R-rated elements might not be inherently negative if the target audience expects that. Since the text is more of a synopsis and a recommendation, the sentiment is likely positive (1). But I need to be careful. If the text is just factual, maybe it's neutral. But the P.S. is a positive statement.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:I am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for \"War of the Worlds\" cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90's. The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a \"perfect translation\". Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic \"dramatic pause\" look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.<br /><br />Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The \"illusion\" of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the \"hero\" gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so in-depth.<br /><br />Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want \"The War of the Worlds\", do one of four things. 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for Spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class).

I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel\u0085if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs!

They mention that SciFi movies lately have been of poor quality, citing examples like \"Minotaur\" and \"Dog Soldiers.\" The main criticism here is that \"Grendel\" deviates a lot from the original story and doesn't live up to expectations. They compare it to a \"shitty Christopher Lambert movie,\" which is clearly a negative comparison. \n\nThe user points out several issues: the inaccuracies in the adaptation, the design choices like the horned helmets and Grendel's size, the way Grendel is killed (not by ripping his arm off but by an exploding arrow), combining Grendel's mother with the dragon, and even the mullet hairstyle. All these points are criticisms. \n\nThe conclusion advises against watching the movie if someone is interested in the connection to the epic, stating there's hardly any. They only recommend it if someone liked another movie \"Druids,\" but even then, they don't recommend either. \n\nThe language used is heavily critical throughout. Words like \"bad luck,\" \"deviates so much,\" \"so little in comparison,\" \"shitty,\" \"massive horned helmets\" (as a negative), \"lacking in every way,\" \"made up junk,\" and \"don't recommend\" all indicate a negative sentiment. There's no positive feedback given except maybe the mention of expecting some artistic integrity, but even that was disappointed.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was \"The Red Violin\"), far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good film, read and see \"Such a Long Journey\".If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the sentiment of the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The user mentioned that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and if negative, it's 0. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by talking about how people outside Canada don't realize the country produces more than just snow, mounties, and hockey players. They mention that this film is the second \"superlative\" Canadian film they've seen recently, with the first being \"The Red Violin.\" The word \"superlative\" means excellent, so that's a strong positive adjective. They also say it's \"far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts,\" which suggests it's even better than most Hollywood movies, except the very top ones. That's definitely a compliment.\n\nNext, they describe the main character, Gustad Noble, as a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in 1970s Bombay. They note that the film \"sensitively explores\" various aspects of his life, including family, friends, and work, and how these affect him. The use of \"sensitively explores\" implies a thoughtful and well-done portrayal. They also call the film a \"fascinating\" and \"accurate\" portrayal of middle-class urban life in India at the time. Both \"fascinating\" and \"accurate\" are positive descriptors.\n\nThe user then mentions they had read the book by Rohinton Mistry beforehand. They acknowledge that the film can't capture all the complexities of the book, which is a common observation when books are adapted into movies. However, they still recommend both the book and the film, saying \"if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good film, read and see 'Such a Long Journey'.\" The phrase \"really good\" is used twice here, reinforcing a positive recommendation.\n\nLooking for any negative cues: The user does say \"it's really unfortunate\" that people don't know more about Canadian films, but that's a lament about others' perceptions, not a negative comment on the film itself. They also mention the film can't capture all the book's complexities, but this is presented as an expected limitation rather than a flaw. The overall tone remains positive despite these points.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space \"bin\" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.<br /><br />The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.<br /><br />Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.<br /><br />However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the \"Terrible movie\" archives and just about nudges it into the \"could have been a cult movie\" archives. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich\u00e9d, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.<br /><br />I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything.<br /><br />Unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the given review of the movie \"Tinseltown\" is positive (1) or negative (0). I need to analyze the text and determine the overall sentiment.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The reviewer says the first 30 minutes had them almost changing the channel. The premise is \"mildly amusing\" but \"painfully bland.\" That's leaning negative. They were not impressed initially.\n\nNext, they mention Joe Pantoliano's character gave them hope, so they kept watching. Then Kristy Swanson's performance added spice, and her acting was solid, more than just eye candy. So some positive points here about the actors saving the movie.\n\nThe third paragraph talks about low-budget issues: poorly shot scenes, stuttered pace, slapstick moments. They compare it to other low-budget films they like, but here the execution isn't as good. Still, this is a negative point.\n\nIn the fourth paragraph, the reviewer says the actors save the movie from being terrible and almost make it a cult classic. They laughed out loud at some scenes, especially with Joe Pantoliano. The penultimate scenes are clich\u00e9d but still funny. So mixed here\u2014actors are good, some laughs, but the movie's flaws are evident.\n\nThe fifth paragraph mentions that the film didn't work well as a movie adaptation of a stage play. The first 30 minutes were so dull that they might have laughed at anything later. Ends with a sarcastic comment about using the DVD as a coaster unless you're desperate. That's pretty negative.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The user wants me to determine if the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The text is a movie review. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe first sentence is \"I loved this movie and will watch it again.\" That's clearly positive. The person loved it and wants to watch it again, so that's a strong positive indicator.\n\nNext, \"Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self.\" The mention of an original twist suggests they found the plot creative or innovative, which is a positive comment. The themes of Man vs Man and Man vs Self are classic, but adding an original twist would be a good thing.\n\nThen, \"I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie.\" Comparing it favorably to his other work, so that's a compliment to the actor and the movie. If they think it's his best, that's definitely positive.\n\n\"His eyes conveyed more than most actors words.\" Praising the actor's performance, specifically his nonverbal acting. Saying his eyes conveyed more than others' words is high praise, so another positive point.\n\nThe last part: \"Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention?\" This is a bit more complex. The mention of \"hope for Mankind\" is positive, but \"in spite of Government Intervention\" could imply criticism towards government. However, in the context of the movie's themes, the reviewer might be reflecting on the movie's message. The question mark at the end might indicate a rhetorical question, but the overall sentiment here seems to lean towards a positive outlook despite challenges. So even if there's a critique of government, the overall takeaway is hopeful, which is positive.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The user provided a sentence and wants to know if it's positive (1) or negative (0). The sentence is: \"I was overtaken by the emotion. Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people. The performances were faultless and outstanding.\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each part of the sentence for positive or negative sentiment.\n\nStarting with \"I was overtaken by the emotion.\" The phrase \"overtaken by emotion\" usually has a positive connotation, like being deeply moved in a good way. But sometimes it could be overwhelming in a negative sense. However, in the context of a review, being emotionally moved is typically positive.\n\nNext, \"Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story...\" \"Unforgettable\" is definitely a strong positive adjective. \"Rendering\" here refers to the portrayal or presentation, so saying it's unforgettable suggests it was very well done. The part about the story being \"unknown to most people\" adds uniqueness, which is a positive aspect because it's highlighting that the film brings attention to a lesser-known story, which is a compliment.\n\nThen, \"The performances were faultless and outstanding.\" Both \"faultless\" and \"outstanding\" are clearly positive adjectives. Faultless means without any flaws, and outstanding means exceptionally good. So this part is definitely positive.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Let's break down the sentence and analyze each part for positive or negative sentiment.\n\n1. \"I was overtaken by the emotion.\" - Typically positive in a review context.\n2. \"Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.\" - \"Unforgettable\" is strong positive, \"unknown\" adds uniqueness and is a compliment.\n3. \"The performances were faultless and outstanding.\" - Both \"faultless\" and \"outstanding\" are clearly positive adjectives.\n\nSince all parts of the sentence have a positive sentiment, the overall sentiment is positive.\n\n\\boxed{1}",

They mention that the creature appears in about thirty seconds of \"marginal stop-motion animation,\" but then they say \"oh how you will long for that margin\" because the rest of the movie replaces the animation with production assistants waving an inner tube with teeth.

The reviewer comments that watching them try to be funny is better than following the sheriff, but that's not a compliment. It's like saying even though the comic relief is bad, it's still better than the other parts, which are plodding.

I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got \"Cult Status\" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling here, I know.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Still the definitive program about the Second World War, The World At War isn't just long, but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most episodes are about the war in Europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa, Burma, the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany, Great Britain, United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. In addition, some of the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.<br /><br />The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, Jimmy Stewart, Bill Mauldin, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten, Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in \"The Making of The World at War\" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff. The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence.<br /><br />The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, The World at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The reviewer mentions watching multiple episodes repeatedly and recommends other similar series.

Just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given text is positive or negative. The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative. Let me read through the review again carefully.\n\nThe review starts by talking about the DVD quality being bad, formatted for TV with a fuzzy picture, which annoyed film purists. The phrase \"rightly so\" suggests the reviewer agrees that the poor quality is a valid complaint. Then they mention the story, which they describe as involving drama, suspense, humor, and sadness. The reviewer says it's an \"involving story\" and overall seems to like the plot and characters, even though the ending gets a bit too sentimental in the last 15 minutes. However, they end by advising people to rent it until a better version comes out, rather than buying the DVD because of the poor quality.\n\nSo, the reviewer has mixed feelings. They praise the story and the characters but criticize the technical aspects of the DVD release. The question is whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The instructions say to consider the entire sentence. The positive aspects are about the story and the film itself, while the negatives are about the DVD quality. The final recommendation is to rent instead of buy, which is a negative point for the DVD but not necessarily the film. However, the user's question is about the entire sentence's sentiment. The reviewer does say \"Overall, it's an involving story...\" which is positive, but ends with a warning about the DVD quality. Since the main focus of the review is the movie's content being good but the DVD being bad, the overall sentiment might lean positive because the story is praised, but the DVD is a separate issue. Wait, but the user is asking if the sentence is positive. The answer depends on whether the overall sentiment is positive despite the DVD issues. The reviewer says \"Overall, it's involving...\" which is positive, but the final advice is negative. However, the question is about the entire text's sentiment. If the reviewer recommends renting it, that's a cautious recommendation but not entirely negative. The presence of both positive and negative elements complicates things. But in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, sometimes the dominant sentiment is considered. The positives about the story are strong, and the negatives are about the DVD quality. Since the film itself is good, but the DVD is bad, the overall sentiment towards the movie might still be positive. However, the user's instruction might consider the entire text, which includes both. But the last sentence says \"Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.\" So the reviewer is saying the movie is worth watching (hence rent), but not buying. So the sentiment towards the movie is positive, but the DVD release is negative. The question is whether the sentence as a whole is positive. The answer would be 1 because the reviewer recommends renting it, indicating that the movie itself is good, even if the DVD quality is poor. The negatives are about the DVD, not the film's content. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents a mixed review but leans positive regarding the film's content while criticizing the DVD quality. The reviewer praises the story, characters, and emotional depth, calling it \"involving\" with a blend of drama, suspense, humor, and sadness. Criticisms focus on technical aspects (poor DVD formatting, fuzzy picture) and an overly sentimental ending. However, the recommendation to \"rent it\" implies the film itself is worthwhile despite the DVD issues.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

This movie is in the same niche genre as \"Away from Her\" - or even \"The Bucket List\" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos.

The user mentioned that if the sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and if negative, it's 0.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully. The person starts by saying they saw a movie and really liked it, even cried, which is a strong positive reaction. They compare it to other movies in the same genre but praise its authenticity in handling the aging theme. That's another positive point.\n\nThey mention the main character, Hagar, is unlikable, but the director handles this challenge masterfully. Even though the character is hard to like, the user appreciates the director's skill. So that's a positive comment on the filmmaking, not negative. \n\nThe user describes Hagar as mean, belittling, selfish, and a stone, but then explains how the movie provides insight into her past, making the viewer understand and even start to like her. The emotional journey from dislike to empathy is highlighted, which is a positive aspect of the storytelling. \n\nThere's a lot of praise for Ellen Burnstyn's acting with multiple \"kudos,\" which is definitely positive. The user also mentions that the movie isn't \"feel good\" but brings the viewer to empathy, indicating that while the subject is tough, the execution is effective. \n\nThe conclusion reflects a deeper understanding of people's hard edges and how the movie helped the user see those traits in others more compassionately. All of these points suggest that the overall sentiment is positive. Even though the movie deals with difficult themes, the user's reaction to the film's quality and impact is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The author starts by saying the movie has one of the strangest themes in history, comparing it to Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\" which I know is often considered a so-bad-it's-good movie. That comparison might be a negative point because Ed Wood's films are notoriously campy and not exactly praised for their quality.\n\nNext, the subject of the movie is bridge, the card game. The reviewer mentions different groups playing it: the Park Avenue set, Bohemians, and Russians. But then they criticize the Russians' accents, both in their native language and when speaking English, as \"very questionable\" and \"unconvincing.\" That's a clear negative point about the acting or authenticity.\n\nThe third paragraph says that if you're not interested in bridge, even with a great cast, you won't be interested in the movie.

            "question": "Given the question statement:After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of \"real teen life.\" Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, \"a film teens should see because it's about them.\" Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like \"Pups\" or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the given text is positive or negative. The user wants a 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again to get a good understanding. The person is talking about a film they saw at the SF Independent Film Festival. They mention that they couldn't wait to get a copy, which sounds positive. Then there's a Q&A with Jim McKay, the director, who discussed the challenges of distributing a film that deals with minorities and controversial issues. The audience, which was diverse in race and gender, mostly adults, really liked the film's storyline, characters, and portrayal of real teen life. However, the teens had left, so the author thinks the film is better for adults with kids to start discussions, rather than being something teens should see just because it's about them. The distribution question comes up again, suggesting it might be hard to find, but the internet is a good avenue. McKay is praised for being sensitive and detailed, working closely with the community and actors to make the film realistic.\n\nNow, breaking this down. The initial excitement about the film and wanting a copy is positive. The audience reaction is described as \"raved,\" which is definitely positive. The director's approach is commended, so that's another positive. The mention of distribution challenges could be a negative, but the text frames it as a problem that can be solved via the internet, and the director is responsive. The fact that teens left might be a negative point, but the author suggests it's better for adults to use as a discussion tool, which isn't necessarily negative\u2014it's more about the target audience. The overall tone seems to praise the film's qualities and the director's work, even if there are some distribution hurdles.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Let's analyze the text again to determine if it's positive or negative.\n\nThe text mentions several positive aspects:\n\n* The author was excited to see the film and wanted to get a copy.\n* The audience, which was diverse in race and gender, \"raved\" about the film's storyline, characters, and portrayal of real teen life.\n* The director, Jim McKay, is praised for being sensitive and detailed in his work, working closely with the community and actors to make the film realistic.\n\nThe text also mentions some potential negative points:\n\n* The teens who attended the screening left early, which might suggest that the film isn't appealing to its target audience.\n* The film's distribution challenges are mentioned, which could be a negative aspect.\n\nHowever, the text frames these challenges as solvable problems, and the author suggests that the film is better suited for adults with kids to use as a discussion tool, rather than being something teens should see just because it's about them.\n\nOverall, the text seems to praise the film's qualities and the director's work, while acknowledging some potential challenges.\n\nTherefore, I would store the final answer in:\n\n\\boxed{1}",

Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of his \"work\"...and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a \"movie\" rental. Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it. Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness.<br /><br />This \"thing\" he \"assembled\" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage) are terrible in this. Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent (in all fields), desperate to grab onto any \"loser\" attention he can for himself.

The user wants to determine if the given text is positive (1) or negative (0). The text is a review of someone named Sam Mraovich's work, specifically a film. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully to understand the sentiment. The review starts by saying Sam should never be allowed to touch a camera again and that he should be arrested for petty larceny if he does. That's a strong negative statement. The reviewer also mentions that anyone who pays to rent his \"garbage\" should be compensated, which implies the work is not worth any money.\n\nThe reviewer refers to this as their first viewing of his work and it will be their last, comparing it unfavorably to Ed Wood, who is known for being a famously bad filmmaker. That's another negative comparison. They plan to return the movie and ask the video store to take it off the shelf, indicating they think it's not suitable for rental.\n\nThe reviewer identifies as a supporter of gay cinema but is angry that this film is marketed as such, feeling it's detrimental to the promotion of gay rights. They criticize the misleading cover art featuring an actor who isn't as appealing in the film and mention the director's appearance in a derogatory way. Words like \"offensive,\" \"irresponsible junk,\" and \"detrimental\" are all negative descriptors.\n\nFurther, the reviewer calls the project a \"reverse vanity project,\" suggesting it's self-indulgent in a bad way. They describe the director and his associate as terrible, no-talent, and desperate for attention. The final line says Sam should be pitied, which is a harsh judgment.\n\nThroughout the text, there's consistent use of negative language and strong criticism. There are no positive remarks about the film or the director.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Didn't Mystic Pizza win the Oscar for that year? This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater. Only \"Wargames\" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future. History has shown that this is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to \"run\" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as \"Captain Freedom\" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as \"Subzero,\" both \"stalkers\" who kill the \"running men.\" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the \"dancers of the future\" are none other than the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS \"80s.\" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as \"contestants.\" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.<br /><br />The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for \"national security\" is downright chilling. Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.<br /><br />The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the \"ravine\" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. \"Serious\" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their \"common man\" counterparts, such as this one.<br /><br />An absolute must-see.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the sentiment of the given text is positive or negative. The user wants to know whether the answer should be 1 (positive) or 0 (negative). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The author is talking about the movie \"The Running Man\" and comparing it to \"Wargames.\" They mention that the movie didn't win an Oscar, which might initially seem negative, but the overall tone seems more about the movie's merits despite that.\n\nThe author starts by saying that \"Mystic Pizza\" didn't win an Oscar, but the focus shifts to \"The Running Man.\" They criticize the casting as a \"pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s,\" which sounds a bit negative, but then they list a lot of actors and elements that are iconic of the 80s, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Dawson, Jesse Ventura, and the Laker Girls. The phrase \"This movie SCREAMS '80s'\" could be a positive nod to its nostalgic or iconic status.\n\nThe plot is described as a \"good excuse for the action,\" which might be a backhanded compliment, but the author seems to appreciate the storyline where Ben Richards fights against a tyrannical government. They mention that the production value was poor and the lines were cheesy, which are negative points. However, the author also talks about the movie being prophetic, comparing its vision of the future to how things have turned out, which is a positive aspect.\n\nThere's a comparison to \"Wargames,\" another movie that the author felt was similarly disturbing and prophetic. The author criticizes the Academy for not recognizing \"The Running Man's\" screenplay, which indicates they think it deserved more acclaim. The statement that \"serious\" actors winning Oscars doesn't make their films better than \"common man\" ones like this movie is a clear endorsement of \"The Running Man\" despite its lack of awards.\n\nThe conclusion calls it an \"absolute must-see,\" which is a strong positive recommendation. Even though there are criticisms about production quality and cheesiness, the overall sentiment is positive because the author praises the movie's foresight, its commentary on society, and its entertainment value. The negative aspects are acknowledged but are outweighed by the positive evaluation of its themes and impact.\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques aspects like production value and cheesy lines but ultimately praises \"The Running Man\" for its prophetic themes, social commentary, and entertainment value. The author compares it favorably to other films and laments its lack of Oscar recognition, ending with a strong recommendation.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
