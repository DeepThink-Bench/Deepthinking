            "question": "Given the question statement:The Texans and Patriots faced off on Sunday Night Football in a game with playoff implications for both teams. Houston received the opening kickoff, going into a three-and-out on the drive. On New England's second drive, Tom Brady found tight end Rob Gronkowski for a 40-yard reception to set up first and goal. To end the drive, Brady found Keshawn Martin for a 2-yard touchdown pass. With Stephen Gostkowski making the extra point the Patriots took a 7-0 lead. On 3rd and 18, Brian Hoyer found Nate Washington for a 49-yard pass to put Houston at New England's 25 yard line. The Texans ended the drive with a 37-yard field goal from Nick Novak to trail 3-7 late in the 1st quarter. The Patriots extended their lead early in the 2nd quarter to 10-3 with a 43-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. After struggling to find their run game after the loss of Arian Foster, Jonathan Grimes took off for 37 yards to put the Texans at the Patriots' 43 yard line. The drive ended with another Novak field goal, this time from 45 yards. With Novak's kick good, Houston trailed 6-10 with 9:26 left in the half. To close out the first half, Tom Brady found Gronkowski for a 1-yard touchdown pass. With Gostkowski making the extra point New England extended their lead to 17-6 going into halftime. The Texans failed to score in the 2nd half, falling to the Patriots 27-6. Hoyer left the game late in the 4th quarter due to a possible concussion, with T. J. Yates coming in as the starting quarterback.Who made the most field goals in the first half?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking who made the most field goals in the first half of the game between the Texans and Patriots. Alright, I need to go through the text carefully and note all the field goals made in the first half.\n\nFirst, the game starts with the Texans receiving the kickoff but they go three-and-out. Then the Patriots score a touchdown with Brady throwing to Keshawn Martin, making it 7-0 after the extra point. So that's a touchdown, not a field goal. \n\nNext, the Texans on 3rd and 18 get a big pass to the Patriots' 25-yard line. They end that drive with a 37-yard field goal by Nick Novak. So that's Novak's first field goal, making the score 3-7. That's in the first quarter.\n\nThen, in the second quarter, the Patriots extend their lead with a 43-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski. That makes the score 10-3. Wait, but the Texans had 3, Patriots 7, then after the field goal, it's 10-3? Wait, no. Let me check again. The Patriots scored a touchdown (7-0), then Texans kicked a field goal (3-7), then Patriots kick a field goal (10-3). Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, the Patriots had 7, then after the Texans' field goal, it's 3-7. Then the Patriots kick a field goal to make it 10-3. Then the Texans later get another field goal by Novak from 45 yards, making it 6-10. Then before halftime, Patriots score another touchdown, making it 17-6. \n\nSo in the first half, the field goals are:\n\n- Texans: Nick Novak made two field goals (37 yards and 45 yards). \n\n- Patriots: Stephen Gostkowski made one field goal (43 yards). \n\nSo Novak has two, Gostkowski has one.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Setu coins or Setu bull coins are found in large quantities in the northern part of Sri Lanka and in Southern India. Codrington in his book Ceylon Coins and Currency published in 1924 and Mitchiner in his book Oriental Coins published in 1978 have clearly pointed out that the traditional design of Sri Lanka standing King Type Copper Massa  of the Jaffna Kingdoms belongs to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD. Setu coins were previously attributed to the Setupati Princes of Ramanathapuram in South India. There are two series one in the issued from the 13th to the 15th centuries and the other after the brief loss of sovereignty to the rival Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467 and reconstitution of the Kingdom. Even during the rule of Sapumal Kumaraya coins were issued in Jaffna that was distinct. Three types of this series are illustrated below. The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi  symbol, the legend Sethu in Tamil with a crescent moon above. There are number of categories of these coins. In type I  is closely aligned with the Chola copper coins of the 13th century although slightly larger in size. The Tamil Setu replaces the Nagari Rajaraja in the cola coins. In type I  the blank is even broader but a recumbent bull appera obverse in a vertical position. In the coin type II the seated figure is replaced with a Bull.How many years did the Aryacakravarti dynasty last?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many years the Aryacakravarti dynasty lasted. The text mentions that Codrington and Mitchiner pointed out that the coins belong to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD. Wait, but then there's another part where after a brief loss of sovereignty to the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467, the kingdom was reconstituted. Hmm, does that mean the dynasty continued after that period?\n\nWait, the initial dates given are 1284 to 1410 AD. That's from the start year to the end year. So subtracting 1284 from 1410 gives 126 years. But then there's mention of the kingdom being reconstituted after 1467. Wait, maybe the dynasty was interrupted between 1410 and 1450, then came back from 1467 onwards? But the question is about how long the dynasty lasted. The text says the coins were issued in two series: one from 13th to 15th centuries, and another after the reconstitution. But the specific dates for the Aryacakravarti rule are given as 1284 to 1410. Then there's a loss of sovereignty from 1450 to 1467. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nThe text says: \"the traditional design ... belongs to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD.\" Then it mentions that there are two series of coins: one from the 13th to 15th centuries, and another after the brief loss of sovereignty to the Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467. Wait, so the first series is up to 1410, then after 1467, they started again. But the dynasty's rule is specifically stated as 1284 to 1410. The reconstitution after 1467 might be a continuation, but the question is about the duration of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. If the dynasty ended in 1410, then the answer would be 1410 - 1284 = 126 years. But if they came back after 1467, does that extend their duration? The text says \"reconstitution of the Kingdom\" but doesn't explicitly say the dynasty continued after 1410. Wait, maybe the dynasty was interrupted between 1410 and 1467, then ruled again from 1467 onwards? But the initial statement says the Aryacakravarti dynasty is from 1284 to 1410. The later coins after 1467 might be from the same dynasty resuming power. However, the text isn't clear on whether the dynasty continued after 1410. Let me re-read the exact sentence: \"the traditional design ... belongs to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD.\" So that's the period they're attributing the coins to. Then the second series is after the loss of sovereignty from 1450 to 1467. Wait, but 1450 is after 1410. So maybe the initial period is 1284-1410, then after a gap (maybe another dynasty took over from Kotte), then they regained sovereignty in 1467 and continued. But the text says \"reconstitution of the Kingdom\" after 1467, but does it mention the dynasty? The text says \"Even during the rule of Sapumal Kumaraya coins were issued in Jaffna that was distinct.\" Sapumal Kumaraya was a ruler from the Kotte kingdom, so during their rule (1450-1467), Jaffna was under Kotte, but after 1467, the Jaffna kingdom was reconstituted. So the Aryacakravarti dynasty might have been restored after 1467. If that's the case, then the dynasty's rule would be from 1284 to 1410, then again from 1467 onwards until when? The text doesn't specify the end date after 1467. The question is about how many years the dynasty lasted. If the text only provides the dates 1284-1410, then that's 126 years. But if the dynasty continued after 1467, but the text doesn't give an end date for that later period, then we can't calculate the total. However, the question is probably referring to the initial period given in the text, which is 1284 to 1410. So 1410 minus 1284 is 126 years.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off a defensively-strong performance against the Cardinals, the Panthers flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 9 NFC South duel with the undefeated New Orleans Saints.  Carolina got off to a fast start in the first quarter as running back DeAngelo Williams got a 66-yard and a 7-yard touchdown run.  The Saints would get on the board in the second quarter as kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal.  The Panthers came right back as kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal, but New Orleans would close out the half as Carney booted a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints continued to hack away as running back Pierre Thomas got a 10-yard touchdown run.  Carolina answered with Kasay's 25-yard field goal, but New Orleans would tie the game to end the period as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem.  Afterwards, the Saints would pull away in the fourth quarter with Carney's 40-yard field goal, followed by defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove forcing a fumble from Williams and returning it 1 yard for a touchdown.How many field goals were kicked in the second quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many field goals were kicked in the second quarter of that Panthers vs. Saints game. The question is asking specifically about the second quarter, so I need to focus on that part of the game description. Let me read through the text again carefully to make sure I don't miss any details.\n\nThe text starts by saying that the Panthers had a strong defensive game against the Cardinals and then went to play the Saints in Week 9. In the first quarter, DeAngelo Williams scored two touchdowns for the Panthers. Then, moving into the second quarter, the Saints got on the board with a 23-yard field goal by John Carney. The Panthers responded with a 32-yard field goal by John Kasay. The Saints closed the half with another Carney field goal, this time from 25 yards. \n\nSo, in the second quarter, there are two mentions of field goals: one by Carney (Saints) and one by Kasay (Panthers). Then another Carney field goal to end the half. Wait, but the half includes the second quarter, right? So the second quarter would end when the half ends. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe text says: \"The Panthers came right back as kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal, but New Orleans would close out the half as Carney booted a 25-yard field goal.\" So the sequence here is in the second quarter, after the Panthers' field goal, the Saints kicked another field goal to close out the half. Since the half is the first and second quarters, closing out the half would mean that the 25-yard field goal by Carney was in the second quarter. Therefore, in the second quarter, there were two field goals: one by Kasay (Panthers) and one by Carney (Saints). Wait, no, wait. Let me parse this again.\n\nWait, the first quarter had Panthers scoring two touchdowns. Then in the second quarter, Saints get a field goal (Carney 23-yard). Then Panthers respond with Kasay's 32-yard field goal. Then Saints close the half with Carney's 25-yard field goal. So that's two field goals in the second quarter: one by Carney and one by Kasay, and then another by Carney. Wait, no. Wait, the Saints' first field goal in the second quarter is 23-yard, then Panthers kick a 32-yard, then Saints kick a 25-yard to close the half. So that's three field goals in the second quarter? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal text:\n\n\"In the second quarter as kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal. The Panthers came right back as kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal, but New Orleans would close out the half as Carney booted a 25-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo the second quarter starts with Saints' 23-yard FG. Then Panthers respond with Kasay's 32-yard FG. Then Saints close the half with Carney's 25-yard FG. Since the half is the first two quarters, the \"close out the half\" part would be in the second quarter. Therefore, in the second quarter, there are three field goals? Wait, no. Wait, the first quarter is already done. The second quarter includes the Saints' first FG (23), Panthers' FG (32), and Saints' FG (25). So that's three field goals in the second quarter. But that seems a lot. Wait, but the way it's written: \"the Saints would get on the board in the second quarter as kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal. The Panthers came right back as kicker John Kasay nailed a 32-yard field goal, but New Orleans would close out the half as Carney booted a 25-yard field goal.\"\n\nSo each of these events is in the second quarter. So three field goals in total in the second quarter? Let me count:\n\n1. Carney (Saints) 23-yard FG in the second quarter.\n2. Kasay (Panthers) 32-yard FG in the second quarter.\n3. Carney (Saints) 25-yard FG in the second quarter (to close the half).\n\nTherefore, three field goals in the second quarter. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. The first quarter had two touchdowns. Then in the second quarter, three field goals? Let me make sure that the \"close out the half\" is indeed part of the second quarter. The half is the first and second quarters. So closing out the half would be at the end of the second quarter. So yes, that 25-yard FG by Carney is in the second quarter. Therefore, three\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Texans' ninth match was an AFC South rivalry match against the Jaguars at EverBank Field. In the first quarter the Texans trailed early as kicker Josh Scobee hit a 38-yard field goal. They replied after kicker Neil Rackers made a 24-yard field goal. They trailed again in the 2nd quarter with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 3 and a 9-yard TD run. However, the lead didn't last long after RB Arian Foster got a 1-yard TD run, and QB Matt Schaub threw a 9-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The Jaguars stayed in the lead when QB David Garrard completed a 52-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller, but the Texans replied again with Schaub finding WR Kevin Walter on an 18-yard TD pass. Suddenly, the Texans' defense broke through with only a few seconds remaining after Garrard made a 50-yard TD pass to WR Mike Thomas. The ball was batted into his hands by Texans Defensive back Glover Quin, who made an attempt to bat the ball to the ground.How many total yards of TD passes were thrown by Garrard?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many total yards of TD passes were thrown by Garrard in the Texans vs. Jaguars game. Alright, so I need to look through the text and find all the instances where David Garrard threw touchdown passes and sum up the yards for each of those passes.\n\nLet me read through the text again carefully. The key parts here are the plays involving Garrard. The text mentions a few scoring plays. Let's break it down quarter by quarter.\n\nFirst quarter: The Jaguars' kicker Scobee made a 38-yard field goal. Then the Texans' kicker Rackers made a 24-yard field goal. So no TD passes by Garrard there.\n\nSecond quarter: The Jaguars' RB Maurice Jones-Drew had two TD runs (3-yard and 9-yard). Those are rushing touchdowns, not passes, so Garrard didn't throw those. Then the Texans scored with Arian Foster's 1-yard TD run and Matt Schaub threw a 9-yard TD pass to Andre Johnson. So those are Texans' scores, not Garrard's.\n\nThen it says the Jaguars stayed in the lead when Garrard completed a 52-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller. Okay, that's one TD pass by Garrard for 52 yards. Got that.\n\nThen the Texans replied with Schaub throwing an 18-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter. Again, not Garrard.\n\nThen, \"Suddenly, the Texans' defense broke through with only a few seconds remaining after Garrard made a 50-yard TD pass to WR Mike Thomas. The ball was batted into his hands by Texans Defensive back Glover Quin, who made an attempt to bat the ball to the ground.\" Wait, so here's another TD pass by Garrard. This one was 50 yards to Mike Thomas. But there's a note about the ball being batted into his hands. Hmm, does that affect the yardage? Probably not. The pass itself was 50 yards, regardless of how it was caught. So that's another 50 yards.\n\nSo adding those two TD passes: 52 yards and 50 yards. 52 + 50 equals 102. So the total yards of TD passes thrown by Garrard would be 102 yards. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other passes.\n\nLooking back through the text again. The only mentions of Garrard's TD passes are the 52-yarder to Zach Miller and the 50-yarder to Mike Thomas. The other touchdowns were either field goals, runs, or passes by Schaub. So yes, those two are the only ones.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Vlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".Which was the larger army, Vlad \u0162epe\u015f' or the Turkish Army?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which army was larger between Vlad \u0162epe\u015f' and the Turkish Army based on the given text.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the information carefully. The text says that Vlad asked the Hungarian king for help but didn't get support. He then mobilized his forces, including men, women, children from twelve up, and Gypsy slaves. The sources mention his army's strength as between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most accepted number being 30,000. \n\nThen there's a letter from Leonardo Tocco that exaggerates both armies. The Turkish army is said to be 400,000, and the Wallachian (Vlad's) army at 200,000. But the text points out that these numbers are exaggerated. The actual numbers for Vlad's army are much lower, around 30,000. The Turkish army's real number isn't given directly, but the letter's 400,000 is an exaggeration. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which was larger. If the Turkish army's actual number isn't stated, but the exaggerated one is 400k versus Vlad's exaggerated 200k, but the real numbers are Vlad's 30k vs. Turkish's actual. However, the text doesn't provide the real Turkish numbers, only that the 400k is an exaggeration. So maybe we have to infer that even though the Turkish numbers were exaggerated, they were still larger than Vlad's actual numbers. Because even if the real Turkish army was, say, 100k, that's still bigger than 30k. But the problem is, the text doesn't give the actual Turkish numbers. The only actual numbers given are Vlad's 30k. The Turkish numbers are only mentioned as 400k in the letter, which is exaggerated. But the question is comparing the two armies. So maybe the answer is that the Turkish army was larger, even considering the exaggeration. Because even if the real number was lower than 400k, it's still bigger than Vlad's 30k. Unless the real Turkish army was smaller than 30k, which seems unlikely. But the text doesn't say. Hmm.\n\nWait, the text says that Leonardo Tocco's letter exaggerated both numbers. So Vlad's army was estimated at 200,000 in the letter, but the actual was around 30,000. The Turkish army was claimed to be 400,000, but that's also an exaggeration. So the real Turkish army must have been less than 400k, but how much less? The text doesn't specify. However, given historical context, the Ottoman Empire's armies were typically larger than those of smaller principalities like Wallachia. So even if the real number was, say, 100k, that's still larger than Vlad's 30k.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Seattle would trail as Colts running back Donald Brown got a 1-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, followed by quarterback Peyton Manning's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. The Seahawks would get on the board with a 38-yard field goal from kicker Olindo Mare, but Indianapolis would close out the half with Manning's 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Austin Collie. Following running back Joseph Addai's 12-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, the Colts would seal the win with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 37-yard and 19-yard field goals. Seattle would end the game with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck getting a 1-yard touchdown run and completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Owen Schmitt.Which player kicked the second longest field goal?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which player kicked the second longest field goal in this game between the Seahawks and the Colts.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In an attempt to take the castle, Itakura Shigemasa was killed. More shogunate troops under Matsudaira Nobutsuna, Itakura's replacement, soon arrived. However, the rebels at Hara Castle resisted the siege for months and caused the shogunate heavy losses. Both sides had a hard time fighting in winter conditions. On February 3, 1638, a rebel raid killed 2,000 warriors from the Hizen Domain. However, despite this minor victory, the rebels slowly ran out of food, ammunition and other provisions. By April 1638, there were over 27,000 rebels facing about 125,000 shogunate soldiers. Desperate rebels mounted an assault against them on April 4 and were forced to withdraw. Captured survivors and the fortress' rumored sole traitor, Yamada Emosaku, revealed the fortress was out of food and gunpowder. On April 12, 1638, troops under the command of the Kuroda clan of Hizen stormed the fortress and captured the outer defenses. The rebels continued to hold out and caused heavy casualties until they were routed on April 15.How many more shogunate soldiers were there compared to rebels in April 1638?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more shogunate soldiers there were compared to the rebels in April 1638. Alright, so I need to find the difference between the number of shogunate soldiers and the rebels during that time.\n\nLooking back at the text, it says: \"By April 1638, there were over 27,000 rebels facing about 125,000 shogunate soldiers.\" So the rebels had 27,000 and the shogunate had 125,000. The question is asking for how many more shogunate soldiers there were, so I need to subtract the number of rebels from the number of shogunate soldiers.\n\nLet me write that down. Shogunate soldiers: 125,000. Rebels: 27,000. The difference would be 125,000 minus 27,000. Let me calculate that. 125,000 minus 20,000 is 105,000. Then subtract 7,000 more, which would be 98,000. So 125,000 - 27,000 = 98,000. \n\nWait, but the text says \"over 27,000 rebels\" and \"about 125,000 shogunate soldiers.\" The word \"over\" and \"about\" indicate approximate numbers.

The population density was . There were 7,849 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 96.8% white, 0.7% black or African American, 0.6% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.5% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 0.6% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 23.4% were Germans, 22.3% were Americans, 13.6% were Irish people, and 11.0% were English people.How many percent were not english?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking, \"How many percent were not English?\" based on the provided census data. Let me read through the text again to make sure I understand the numbers.\n\nSo, the text says that in terms of ancestry, 23.4% were Germans, 22.3% were Americans, 13.6% were Irish people, and 11.0% were English people. The question is about the percentage that were not English. Hmm. Wait, but does this mean that these percentages are the ancestry breakdown, and we need to find out what percentage of the population does not have English ancestry?\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says \"how many percent were not English?\" But in the context of the data given, it's referring to ancestry. So, if 11.0% were English, then the percentage not of English ancestry would be 100% minus 11.0%, which is 89.0%. But wait, let me check if there's more to it.\n\nWait, the data provided includes other racial categories as well: 96.8% white, 0.7% black, 0.6% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% other races, 1.5% two or more races. Hispanic or Latino origin is 0.6%. But the question is specifically about ancestry, not race. The ancestry breakdown is given as German, American, Irish, and English. So, those percentages add up to 23.4 + 22.3 + 13.6 + 11.0. Let me add those numbers: 23.4 + 22.3 is 45.7, plus 13.6 is 59.3, plus 11.0 is 70.3%. So, the total ancestry percentages listed add up to 70.3%. That leaves 29.7% unaccounted for in terms of ancestry. But the question is about the percentage not English. So, if 11.0% are English, then the rest would be 100% - 11.0% = 89.0%. But wait, does that make sense?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the ancestry percentages don't add up to 100%. The text says \"in terms of ancestry, 23.4% were Germans, 22.3% were Americans, 13.6% were Irish people, and 11.0% were English people.\" So, these are the top ancestries reported, but they don't sum to 100%. So, the remaining percentage would be other ancestries not listed. So, when the question asks \"how many percent were not English,\" it's possible that they are referring to the entire population, so if 11.0% reported English ancestry, then 100% - 11.0% = 89.0% did not report English ancestry. But I need to confirm if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us by using the racial makeup data. Let me check again. The racial makeup is 96.8% white, etc., but the question is about ancestry, not race. The paragraph starts with \"in terms of ancestry,\" so the percentages given there are separate from the racial categories.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

War would not again break out between the Habsburgs and Ottomans until 1593, in the Long Turkish War. However, throughout this period of peace small-scale warfare continued, a conflict known as the \"Little War\" . No large armies or sustained campaigns were launched, but authorities on both sides continually struggled with hostile raiders and forays across the poorly-demarcated border. Both sides, however, desired that peace continue.How many years did these events span for?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many years these events span. The text mentions that peace was concluded in Edirne in 1568, and then renewed in 1576, 1584, and 1591. Then it says war broke out again in 1593. The period of peace with the \"Little War\" continued until 1593. So I need to calculate the time from the start of the peace in 1568 until the war resumed in 1593.\n\nWait, but the question is about the span of these events. The events include the initial peace in 1568, the renewals in 1576, 1584, 1591, and then the outbreak of war in 1593. But the period of peace with the Little War lasted until 1593. So the total years would be from 1568 to 1593. To find the span, subtract 1568 from 1593. Let me do that: 1593 minus 1568. That's 25 years. But wait, if the peace started in 1568 and ended in 1593 when the war began, the duration is from 1568 to 1593. However, when calculating the span between two years, you subtract the start year from the end year. So 1593 - 1568 = 25. But sometimes, depending on whether the end year is included. For example, if something starts in 1568 and ends in 1569, that's 1 year, but 1569 - 1568 = 1. So maybe it's correct here. So the answer is 25 years. Let me check again. The peace was from 1568 to 1593, which is 25 years. The events mentioned (the peace treaties and the Little War) span from 1568 to 1593. So 1593 - 1568 = 25.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 83.5 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 77.7 males.How many percent were not from 45 to 64?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage of the population that is not from 45 to 64 years old. Hmm. The given data includes different age groups: under 18, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65 or older. Each of these has a percentage. The 45-64 age group is 21.4%, so to find the percentage not in that group, I need to subtract that from 100%, right?\n\nWait, let me make sure. The total population should add up to 100%, so if I take away the 45-64 percentage, the rest should be the answer. Let me check the numbers again. The percentages are 28.1%, 9.2%, 26.2%, 21.4%, and 15.1%. Let me add them up to confirm. \n\n28.1 + 9.2 is 37.3. Then 37.3 + 26.2 is 63.5. Then 63.5 + 21.4 is 84.9. Then 84.9 + 15.1 equals 100%. Okay, that adds up correctly. So the 45-64 group is 21.4%, so the rest would be 100% - 21.4% = 78.6%. \n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"how many percent were not from 45 to 64?\" So yes, subtracting 21.4% from 100% gives the total percentage not in that age group. The other information given, like the median age and the male-to-female ratios, probably isn't needed here. The question is straightforward once you realize it's just asking for the complement of the 45-64 percentage. \n\nLet me double-check. If 21.4% are 45-64, then the remaining 78.6% are in other age groups. That seems right. The other percentages add up to 28.1 + 9.2 + 26.2 +15.1.

In the second quarter, New York soared into the lead with Feely's 41-yard field goal and running back Thomas Jones' 71-yard touchdown run.  However, Buffalo rallied to tie the game in the third quarter with Lindell's 25-yard field goal and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.  After both teams failed to get any point in the fourth quarter, the game went into overtime.  Despite getting the ball to start off OT, the Jets failed to get any point out of their opening drive.  After a hard-fought period, the Bills would emerge on top as Lindell booted the game-winning 47-yard field goal. Thomas Jones would have a career day as he ran 22 times for a franchise-best 210 yards (in addition to his rushing touchdown).how many yards did Fitzpatrick pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many yards Fitzpatrick passed. So, I need to find the passing yards by Ryan Fitzpatrick in this game.\n\nLooking at the text provided, let me go through each part step by step. The game is between the Jets and the Bills. The key parts here are the scoring plays and any mentions of Fitzpatrick's passing.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Jets took the lead with a field goal and a 71-yard touchdown run by Thomas Jones. Then, in the third quarter, the Bills tied the game with a field goal and a touchdown pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Lee Evans. The touchdown pass is mentioned as 37 yards. So, that's a 37-yard touchdown pass. \n\nNow, the question is, does the 37 yards refer to the length of the pass, meaning Fitzpatrick threw a 37-yard pass to Evans for the touchdown? If that's the case, then that would be part of his passing yards. But sometimes, the play might have more yards if there were other completions. However, the text only mentions the 37-yard touchdown pass. There's no other mention of Fitzpatrick's other passes or yardage. \n\nWait, the text also mentions that Thomas Jones had 210 rushing yards, but that's rushing, not passing. The only passing play mentioned is the 37-yard TD pass. So unless there are other passing plays that aren't mentioned here, the total passing yards for Fitzpatrick would be just that 37-yard pass. But that seems too low. Maybe I need to check if there's more information.\n\nThe problem is that the text is a summary of the game, not a full play-by-play. So it's possible that Fitzpatrick had other completions, but they aren't mentioned here. However, the question is based solely on the information given in the text.

LB Mathias Kiwanuka suffered a broken left fibula, ending his season.Which team had the lead at the end of the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which team was leading at the end of the third quarter in this game between the Giants and the Lions. The question gives a play-by-play of each quarter, so I need to track the scores quarter by quarter and see where things stood after the third quarter.\n\nStarting with the first quarter: The Giants scored a 28-yard field goal by Lawrence Tynes. That's 3 points. The Lions didn't score anything in the first quarter, so after Q1, Giants lead 3-0.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Brandon Jacobs. A touchdown is worth 6 points, and assuming they made the extra point, that's 7 points. So adding that to their previous 3, the Giants now have 10 points (3+7=10). The Lions still didn't score in the second quarter, so at halftime, the score is Giants 10, Lions 0.\n\nMoving on to the third quarter. The Lions finally get on the board with a 42-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. That's 3 points. So now the Lions have 3. Then the Giants respond with another field goal by Tynes, this time from 46 yards. That's another 3 points, bringing their total to 13 (10+3=13). So after the third quarter, the score should be Giants 13, Lions 3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The third quarter scoring: Lions kick a FG (3), then Giants kick a FG (3). So yes, Giants had 10 before the third quarter. Adding 3 makes it 13. Lions had 0 before the third, then added 3. So after Q3, it's 13-3 Giants.\n\nThe fourth quarter is mentioned, but the question is about the end of the third quarter, so the fourth quarter's scoring doesn't matter here.

There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their win over the Bears the Redskins flew to Ford Field for an NFC duel with the Lions. In the 2nd quarter the Redskins trailed early as QB Matthew Stafford got a 13-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. They pulled ahead with QB Donovan McNabb getting a 6-yard TD pass to RB Ryan Torain, followed by kicker Graham Gano making a 38 and a 46-yard field goal. The Redskins trailed slightly with Stafford getting a 2-yard TD pass to TE Brandon Pettigrew. The Redskins got the lead back with RB Keiland Williams getting a 5-yard TD run (With a failed 2-point conversion). The Lions replied with Stafford finding Johnson again on a 7-yard TD pass (With a failed 2-point conversion). After that, the Redskins took the lead again with WR Brandon Banks returning a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion) to put the Redskins up 25-20. They soon fell behind with Stafford throwing a 10-yard TD pass to Johnson (With a successful 2-point conversion as Stafford passed to WR Bryant Johnson). This was followed by kicker Jason Hanson making a 32-yard field goal, and with DT Ndamukong Suh returning a fumble 17 yards to the endzone for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion). With the loss, the Redskins went into their bye week at 4-4.How many games had the Redskins played after the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many games the Redskins had played after the game described here. The question is asking for the total number of games they played after this particular game against the Lions. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the information given. The text starts by saying that the Redskins are coming off a win over the Bears. Then they flew to Ford Field to play the Lions. So that's two games mentioned here: the Bears game and the Lions game. The game against the Lions is detailed in the text, and after that, they mention that with the loss, the Redskins went into their bye week at 4-4. \n\nWait, so after the Lions game, their record is 4-4. A bye week is a week when a team doesn't play a game, so the next game would be after the bye. But the question is asking how many games they had played after this game (the Lions game). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify: the question is asking for the total number of games played by the Redskins up to and including this game. Because the answer would be their total games played so far.\n\nSince their record is 4-4 after this game, that means they have 4 wins and 4 losses, totaling 8 games. So 8 games played. Let me check that again. If a team has a 4-4 record, that's 8 games total. The game against the Lions was their 8th game, which they lost, making their record 4-4. Then they have their bye week.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off an impressive blowout of the Denver Broncos, the Texans packed up and traveled to Indianapolis to do battle with their division rival. Houston drew first blood with as QB Sage Rosenfels threw a 17-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter. The Colts responded to the TD with a 29-yard Vinatieri field goal. The Colts, who got off to a slow start in the 1st Quarter, scored three touchdowns in the 2nd quarter, a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai and two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark. In the 3rd quarter, the Colts continued to pull away from the struggling Texans. Clifton Dawson scored a 4-yard TD Run and Manning passed to Reggie Wayne for a 7-yard TD. In the 4th quarter, the Colts put in backups and QB Sage Rosenfels threw a 6-yard TD to Andre Johnson and Darius Walker rushed up the middle for the 2-Point Conversion. The Texans fell 38-15, ending their 2-game win streak and hopes for their first winning season.Which player caught the shortest measured passing touchdown in this game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which player caught the shortest measured passing touchdown in this game. The question is about an NFL game between the Houston Texans and the Indianapolis Colts. The user provided a detailed text of the game's scoring plays, so I need to parse through that to find all the passing touchdowns and their yardages.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the touchdowns mentioned and note which ones are passing TDs. The key here is to look for instances where a quarterback throws a touchdown pass to a receiver. Let's go through each quarter as described.\n\nStarting with the Texans in the first quarter: Sage Rosenfels throws a 17-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter. That's a 17-yard passing touchdown. Then the Colts respond with a field goal, which isn't a touchdown, so we can skip that.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Colts score three touchdowns. The first is a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai. That's a rushing TD, not a pass. Then Peyton Manning throws two TD passes to Dallas Clark. The text doesn't specify the yardage here, just says \"two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark.\" Wait, that's a problem. The user might have made a mistake here, but according to the text, it's two TD passes to Clark. However, the yardages aren't given. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the text says: \"a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai and two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark.\" So the two TD passes to Clark don't have their yardages mentioned here. That's a bit confusing. But maybe in the original context, those two TD passes are part of the second quarter, but the user didn't specify the yards. Wait, but the user is asking for the shortest measured passing touchdown. If the yardages for Clark's TDs aren't given, how can we compare? Wait, maybe I need to check the rest of the text to see if there are other passing TDs with specified yardages.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Colts continued with a 4-yard TD run by Clifton Dawson (rushing) and Manning passes to Reggie Wayne for a 7-yard TD. That's a 7-yard passing TD. Then in the fourth quarter, the Texans' Sage Rosenfels throws a 6-yard TD to Andre Johnson, and they also get a 2-point conversion. So that's a 6-yard passing TD.\n\nSo compiling all the passing touchdowns:\n\n1. 1st quarter: 17-yard TD pass from Rosenfels to Walter (Texans)\n2. 2nd quarter: Two TD passes from Manning to Clark (Colts) \u2013 but no yardage given\n3. 3rd quarter: 7-yard TD pass from Manning to Wayne (Colts)\n4. 4th quarter: 6-yard TD pass from Rosenfels to Johnson (Texans)\n\nWait, but the problem here is that the two TD passes to Dallas Clark in the second quarter don't have their yardages specified. The user's text just says \"two Peyton Manning TD passes to Dallas Clark\" without mentioning the yards. That's an issue because if those passes were shorter than 6 yards, then Clark would have the shortest. But since the user didn't provide the yardages for those two, maybe we have to assume that the information given in the text is complete, and the answer is based on the provided data. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the two TD passes to Clark do have yardages, but they were omitted. Wait, let me check the original text again carefully.\n\nOriginal text: \"The Colts, who got off to a slow start in the 1st Quarter, scored three touchdowns in the 2nd quarter, a 2-yard TD run by Joseph Addai and two Peyton Manning TD passes to tight end Dallas Clark.\"\n\nSo the structure here is that in the 2nd quarter, the Colts scored three touchdowns: one was Addai's 2-yard run, and the other two were Manning's passes to Clark. The problem is that the yardages for Clark's TDs aren't mentioned. However, in the context of such game summaries, typically each scoring play's yardage is mentioned. So perhaps this is an oversight in the text. But since the user provided this exact text, we have to work with what's given. If the yardages for Clark's TDs aren't specified, then we can't consider them in the comparison.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20. In 2013, the percentage of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent. Of Philadelphias adults, 31 percent were married or lived as a couple, 55 percent were not married, 11 percent were divorced or separated, and 3 percent were widowed.How many in percent of households weren't married couples living together?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this percentage. The question is asking how many percent of households weren't married couples living together. \n\nFirst, let me look back at the data provided. In 2010, it says that 28.3 percent of households were married couples living together. So, if that's the percentage that *were* married couples, then the percentage that *weren't* should be the remaining, right?\n\nBut wait, percentages in such categories can sometimes add up to more than 100% if there are overlapping categories, but I need to check if the categories are mutually exclusive. Let me read the text again.\n\nThe text lists several categories: 24.9% with children under 18, 28.3% married couples, 22.5% female householder no husband, 6.0% male householder no wife, and 43.2% non-families. Then it also mentions 34.1% households as individuals and 10.5% someone 65+ alone. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. Are these categories overlapping?\n\nWait, maybe the first set of percentages (24.9, 28.3, 22.5, 6.0, 43.2) are different breakdowns. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nThe first sentence: \"In 2010, 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.3 percent were married couples living together and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0 percent had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.2 percent were non-families.\"\n\nWait, this seems like a list of different household types. So, perhaps these are separate categories. Let me check if they sum up to 100% or not. Let's add them up:\n\n24.9 (children under 18) + 28.3 (married couples) + 22.5 (female householder no husband) + 6.0 (male householder no wife) + 43.2 (non-families) = Let's compute step by step.\n\n24.9 + 28.3 = 53.2\n\n53.2 + 22.5 = 75.7\n\n75.7 + 6.0 = 81.7\n\n81.7 + 43.2 = 124.9\n\nWait, that's 124.9%, which is more than 100%. That can't be right. So, these categories must overlap. For example, a household can be both a married couple and have children under 18. So, the percentages are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, I can't just subtract 28.3% from 100% to get the answer. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the percentage of households that weren't married couples living together. So, if 28.3% were married couples, then the rest should be non-married couples. But if the categories overlap, how do we handle that?\n\nWait, maybe the 28.3% is the total percentage of households that are married couples, regardless of other factors. So even if some of those married couples also have children under 18, they are still counted in the 28.3%. So, in that case, the total percentage of households that are not married couples would be 100% - 28.3% = 71.7%.\n\nBut let me check if the text mentions anything else. The next part says \"the city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.\" These might be subsets of the non-family or other categories. But the question is about not being married couples. So, perhaps the answer is 100% - 28.3% = 71.7%.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the initial categories add up to more than 100%, so maybe the 28.3% is part of a different categorization. Let me read the original text again carefully.\n\n\"In 2010, 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.3 percent were married couples living together and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0 percent had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.2 percent were non-families.\"\n\nSo, the way this is written, each of these is a separate statistic.

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1574 the Captaincy General of the Philippines was created as a dependency of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1584, the Real Audiencia of Manila is established by King Felipe II, who appointed as its President the same governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. The Captaincy had its capital in Cebu from 1565 to 1595, and in Manila from 1595 until 1898. As part of the extensive governmental reforms during the early Bourbon period throughout the overseas possessions, an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree of July 17, 1784 that handled issues regarding the government finances and to promote the economy. Ciriaco Gonz\u00e1lez Carbajal was appointed as Oidor of the Audiencia of Manila and was instructed to abide by the Royal Ordinance of Mayors of 1782, that had been enacted in Rio de la Plata. Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu, and although they were created on November 24, 1786, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787. A month earlier, on October 23, the Intendencia of Manila had been attached to the Captaincy General of the Philippines. Until 1822, all General Captains were civilians, but after that year they were always chosen among the military. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, there were established many dependent local government offices and military settlements, very numerous due to a large number of islands and the extent of the districts.How many years did it take to abolish the Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many years it took to abolish the Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the text provided to find the relevant dates. Let me read through the paragraph again carefully.\n\nThe text says that Ciriaco Gonz\u00e1lez Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in those regions, and they were created on November 24, 1786. Then, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787. So, the Intendencias were created in 1786 and abolished in 1787. \n\nWait, but the question is asking how many years it took to abolish them. So, from the creation date to the abolition date, how many years passed? Let me check the exact dates. They were created on November 24, 1786, and abolished on November 20, 1787. That's less than a full year apart. From November 1786 to November 1787 is almost exactly one year, but since the abolition was on November 20, 1787, which is a few days before the one-year anniversary of their creation, the time between is just under a year. However, when calculating the number of years between two dates in the same month but different years, even if it's just a few days short, sometimes it's counted as one year. But in other contexts, it might be considered less than a year. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many years did it take to abolish,\" so they might be looking for the difference in the years, regardless of the exact months. So 1787 minus 1786 equals 1 year. Even though the actual time was 11 months and 27 days (from Nov 24, 1786, to Nov 20, 1787), the difference in years is 1 year.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to build on the momentum of their comeback win at Miami, the Broncos donned their alternate orange jerseys and returned home for an interconference duel with the Detroit Lions. The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with a 39-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Lions would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 41-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young, followed in the second quarter by a 50-yard field goal by placekicker Jason Hanson, a 1-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to tight end Tony Scheffler and a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Maurice Morris, giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead. The Lions continued their domination in the third quarter, with a 24-yard fumble return for a touchdown by defensive end Cliff Avril, a 56-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, followed in the fourth quarter by cornerback Chris Houston returning an interception off Broncos' quarterback Tim Tebow 100 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos finally got into the end zone, with Tebow throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in Detroit's favor.How many points ahead was Detroit going into halftime?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many points ahead Detroit was going into halftime. So I need to figure out the score at halftime and then subtract the Broncos' score from the Lions' score to get the point difference.\n\nFirst, let me go through the text again to pick out the relevant information. The Broncos had a comeback win at Miami before this game, but that's probably just context. They played the Lions at home in orange jerseys. The first quarter: Broncos got a 39-yard field goal by Matt Prater. So that's 3 points for the Broncos. Then the Lions started dominating. \n\nIn the first quarter, after the Broncos' field goal, the Lions scored a 41-yard TD pass from Stafford to Titus Young. A touchdown is 6 points, plus the extra point is 7 total. Then in the second quarter, Lions have a 50-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, which is 3 points. Then a 1-yard TD pass from Stafford to Tony Scheffler, another 7 points. Then a 1-yard TD run by Maurice Morris, another 7 points. So that's all in the first half. \n\nSo let's add up the Lions' points in the first half. The first TD is 7, then 3 for the field goal, then another 7, then another 7. Wait, let me check again. The text says: \"the Lions would dominate the remainder of the game, beginning with a 41-yard touchdown pass... followed in the second quarter by a 50-yard field goal... a 1-yard touchdown pass... and a 1-yard touchdown run... giving Detroit a 24-3 halftime lead.\" Wait, the text actually says the halftime score was 24-3. So maybe I don't need to calculate it step by step. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, the Broncos had 3 points from the first quarter. Then the Lions scored 7 (TD) + 3 (FG) + 7 (TD) + 7 (TD) = 24 points. So 24 for Lions, 3 for Broncos. So the difference is 24 - 3 = 21 points. But the question is asking how many points ahead Detroit was going into halftime.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at  El Ksiba in April 1922.  Said was forced to flee, with much of the A\u00eft Ichkern tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas.  Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas.  Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to garrisons in Germany, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit.  Said never did so, dying in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade.  Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936.  Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comit\u00e9 d'Action Marocaine  in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951.  France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan Mohammed V and already fighting a bloody war of independence in Algeria, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956.How many years past from spring 1922 to when Said died?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many years passed from spring 1922 to when Said died. Let me read through the text again to make sure I get the details right.\n\nThe text says that in Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks and defeated Said at El Ksiba in April 1922. Then Said fled and later died in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924. So the key dates here are spring 1922 (specifically April 1922) and March 1924. \n\nWait, the question is from spring 1922 to when Said died. The death was in March 1924. So we need to calculate the time between April 1922 and March 1924. Let's break it down. From April 1922 to April 1923 is one year. Then from April 1923 to March 1924 is another 11 months. So that's a total of 1 year and 11 months. But the question asks for how many years passed. Since it's not a full two years yet by March 1924, the difference is just under two years. However, when calculating the number of years between two dates, if the months are counted, sometimes it's considered as the difference in the year numbers. Let me check that again.\n\nThe start is 1922, and the end is 1924. So 1924 minus 1922 is 2 years. But since the death was in March 1924 and the start was in April 1922, it's actually 1 year and 11 months, which is just shy of two full years. But depending on how the question is phrased, sometimes they just take the difference in the years. Wait, but the question says \"how many years past from spring 1922 to when Said died\". If we count the years passed, even if it's not a full two years, the answer would be 2 years? Or is it 1 year?\n\nWait, let's think. From April 1922 to April 1923 is one year. Then from April 1923 to March 1924 is 11 months. So total time is 1 year and 11 months, which is approximately 1.916 years. But the question is asking for the number of years. If we are to express this in whole years, it's 1 full year and part of the second. But maybe the answer is 2 years because it spans from 1922 to 1924. However, if the exact months are considered, it's less than two years. But the problem is phrased as \"how many years past\", so maybe they just subtract the years: 1924 minus 1922 equals 2 years. But that's not accurate because the start is in 1922 and end in 1924, but only 1 year and 11 months. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 2 years because the events occurred in two different calendar years. But that's not precise. Let me check the exact dates again. The attack was in April 1922, and Said died in March 1924. So from April 1922 to March 1924 is 23 months. 23 divided by 12 is 1.916 years. But the question is asking for how many years passed. If they want the answer in whole numbers, it's 2 years. But maybe they expect the exact count. Wait, the problem says \"how many years past from spring 1922 to when Said died\". If we take spring 1922 as April 1922 and death in March 1924, that's 1 year and 11 months. So in terms of years, it's 1 year plus 11/12 of a year. But the answer is probably 2 years if we count each year once. Wait, but 1922 to 1924 is two years, but since it's from the start of 1922 to the end of 1924, but here it's from April 1922 to March 1924. So the actual time is 23 months, which is 1 year and 11 months. So the answer would be 1 year if we're counting full years, but the question might be looking for the difference in the years, which is 1924 - 1922 = 2 years. But that's not correct because it's not two full years. Wait, but maybe in historical contexts, they just count the number of years between the two dates, regardless of the months. For example, from 1922 to 1924 is two years. But if the death was in March 1924, then it's 1924 - 1922 = \n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Friedrich Engels wrote The Peasant War in Germany , which opened up the issue of the early stages of German capitalism on later bourgeois \"civil society\" at the level of peasant economies. Engels' analysis was picked up in the middle 20th century by the French Annales School, and Marxist historians in East Germany and Britain. Using Karl Marx's concept of historical materialism,  Engels portrayed the events of 1524-1525 as prefiguring the 1848 Revolution. He wrote, \"Three centuries have passed and many a thing has changed; still the Peasant War is not so impossibly far removed from our present struggle, and the opponents who have to be fought are essentially the same. We shall see the classes and fractions of classes which everywhere betrayed 1848 and 1849 in the role of traitors, though on a lower level of development, already in 1525.\" Engels ascribed the failure of the revolt to its fundamental conservatism. This led both Marx and Engels to conclude that the communist revolution, when it occurred, would be led not by a peasant army but by an urban proletariat.Which happened first, the Revolution, or the events of 1524-1525?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which happened first: the Revolution or the events of 1524-1525. The text mentions Friedrich Engels wrote about the Peasant War in Germany, which took place in 1524-1525.

The question is which came first.\n\nWait, the options aren't given, but the question is phrased as \"which happened first, the Revolution, or the events of 1524-1525?\" So the Revolution here probably refers to the 1848 Revolution that Engels compared to the Peasant War.

Two revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers.How many years after the April Uprising was the Berlin Treaty signed?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many years after the April Uprising the Berlin Treaty was signed.\n\nFirst, I need to find the dates of both events. The April Uprising happened in 1876, right? The text says the uprising broke out in 1876. Then the Russo-Turkish War was from 1877-1878, which led to the Treaty of San Stefano. But the Berlin Treaty came after that. The text mentions the 1878 Berlin Treaty, which partitioned the territory set by the San Stefano Treaty. \n\nSo the April Uprising was in 1876, and the Berlin Treaty was in 1878. To find the number of years between them, subtract 1876 from 1878. That gives 2 years. But wait, I should check if the treaty was signed in the same year as the uprising ended. The uprising was in April 1876, and the Berlin Treaty was in 1878. So from April 1876 to sometime in 1878.

This would be a rematch of last year's AFC Divisional game. The Ravens drew first blood when Joe Flacco found Vonta Leach on a 2-yard touchdown pass to take the lead 7-0 in the first quarter for the only score of the period.  The Broncos would tie the game in the 2nd quarter with Peyton Manning finding Julius Thomas on a 24-yard pass to take the game to 7-7.  The Ravens moved back into the lead when Ray Rice ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make the score 14-7.  Peyton would find Julius again on a 23-yard pass to make the score 14-14 for another tie before the Ravens kicker Justin Tucker nailed a 25-yard field goal to make the score 17-14 at halftime.  In the 3rd quarter, the Broncos went right back to work as Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-17 lead followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.  Later on in the quarter, Peyton would find Demaryius Thomas on a 26-yard pass to increase the lead to 42-17.  The Ravens tried to rally a comeback in the last quarter, with Flacco finding Marlon Brown on a 13-yard pass to shorten the Broncos' lead 42-24 followed up by Tucker's 30-yard field goal to make the score 42-27.  However, the Broncos wrapped things up in the game when Peyton found D. Thomas again on a 78-yard pass to make the final score 49-27.  The Ravens began their season 0-1 for the first time under John Harbaugh as head coach and Joe Flacco as their starter.  They also lost their first regular season opening game since 2007 as well as becoming the 2nd straight defending Super Bowl champion team to lose their season opener.How many points did Broncos score in the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many points the Broncos scored in the third quarter of their game against the Ravens. I need to go through the text and pick out all the scoring plays the Broncos made in the third quarter.\n\nFirst, let me recall the structure of a football game. A game has four quarters: first, second, third, and fourth. The third quarter is after halftime, so any scoring mentioned after halftime would be in the third or fourth quarters. The text mentions that after halftime, in the third quarter, the Broncos went back to work. Let me check the exact sentences.\n\nThe text says: \"In the 3rd quarter, the Broncos went right back to work as Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-17 lead followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17. Later on in the quarter, Peyton would find Demaryius Thomas on a 26-yard pass to increase the lead to 42-17.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down. Each touchdown is worth 6 points, and assuming they made the extra point each time (since it's standard unless mentioned otherwise), each touchdown would be 7 points. Let's check each scoring play:\n\n1. 28-yard TD pass to Andre Caldwell: 7 points (6 for TD + 1 extra point). This took the score from 17-14 (Ravens leading at halftime) to 21-17 Broncos. Wait, but the halftime score was Ravens 17, Broncos 14. So after this TD, Broncos lead 21-17. That's 7 points.\n\n2. Then, two consecutive TD passes to Wes Welker: first a 5-yard pass, then a 2-yard pass. Wait, the text says \"2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out\". Hmm, does that mean two touchdowns? Let me parse that. \"followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.\" So, first a 5-yard TD pass to Welker, making it 28-17. Then a 2-yard TD pass to Welker, making it 35-17. Wait, but two touchdowns in the same quarter? Each of those would be 7 points each. So that's 14 points from those two TDs.\n\nThen later in the quarter, another TD pass to Demaryius Thomas for 26 yards, making it 42-17. That's another 7 points.\n\nSo adding those up: 7 (Caldwell) + 7 (Welker first) + 7 (Welker second) + 7 (D. Thomas) = 28 points in the third quarter? Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the text says \"followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.\" Wait, maybe \"2 consecutive passes\" refers to two touchdowns? So first, after the Caldwell TD (21-17), they scored another TD with Welker from 5 yards, making it 28-17. Then another TD from 2 yards to Welker, making it 35-17. Then later in the quarter, another TD to D. Thomas, 42-17. So that's three touchdowns in the third quarter: Caldwell, Welker twice, then Thomas. Wait, but three TDs would be 21 points (3x7). Wait, but the text says \"2 consecutive passes\" resulting in two touchdowns? That would be two TDs. Then another TD later. So total three TDs, 21 points. Wait, but the score goes from 21-17 to 28-17 (7 points), then 35-17 (another 7), then 42-17 (another 7). So three TDs, 21 points. So the third quarter total would be 21 points. But wait, the initial score at halftime was 17-14 Ravens. Then Broncos scored 21 in the third quarter? Wait, but the first TD in the third quarter made it 21-17 Broncos. Then they scored again to make it 28-17 (7 points), then 35-17 (another 7), then 42-17 (another 7). Wait, that's four touchdowns? Wait, no.

The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each.How many dollars would it have cost to buy the first paperback edited by Lin Carter, the second Bellerophon issue and the Fall 1988 issue of the Terminus Weird Tales?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how much it would cost to buy three specific items: the first paperback edited by Lin Carter, the second Bellerophon issue, and the Fall 1988 issue of Terminus Weird Tales. The text gives a bunch of pricing information, so I need to parse through that and pick out the relevant numbers.\n\nFirst, let's break down each part step by step. The question is asking for the total cost in dollars, so I need to make sure I get each individual price right and then add them up.\n\nStarting with the first paperback edited by Lin Carter. The text says: \"The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95.\" So, the first three are $2.50 each. Since we need the first one, that's straightforward: $2.50.\n\nNext, the second Bellerophon issue. The text mentions: \"The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95.\" There are two issues here. The first one is $2.50, and the second one is $2.95. So the second Bellerophon issue is $2.95.\n\nThen, the Fall 1988 issue of Terminus Weird Tales. The text states: \"The Terminus Weird Tales began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue.\" So, the Fall 1988 issue is specifically mentioned as $4.00.\n\nNow, adding up these three amounts: $2.50 (Lin Carter's first paperback) + $2.95 (second Bellerophon) + $4.00 (Fall 1988 Terminus Weird Tales). Let me do the math here.\n\nFirst, $2.50 + $2.95. Let's add the dollars and cents separately. 2 + 2 = 4 dollars. 50 cents + 95 cents = 145 cents, which is $1.45. So, 4 + 1.45 = $5.45. Then add the $4.00. $5.45 + $4.00 = $9.45.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 2.50 + 2.95. Hmm, 2.50 + 2 is 4.50, and then +0.95 is 5.45. Then 5.45 + 4.00 is indeed 9.45. So the total should be $9.45.\n\nBut let me double-check each component again to ensure I didn't mix up any numbers. For the first paperback, it's definitely the first of Lin Carter's, which is $2.50. The second Bellerophon issue is the second one, which is $2.95. The Fall 1988 Terminus Weird Tales is $4.00. Yes, that's correct. So adding those three gives $2.50 + $2.95 + $4.00 = $9.45.\n\nI think that's right. Let me just scan through the text again to confirm there's no other information that might affect this. The rest of the text talks about other price changes for the magazine over the years, the digest-sized issues, Nth Dimension Media, etc., but those don't pertain to the three items in question.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos made their first visit to Tampa Bay since 2004. Cornerback Aqib Talib, who made his return to Tampa Bay where he played for the Buccaneers from 2018-2012, intercepted Buccaneers' quarterback Jameis Winston on the third play of the opening drive. The Broncos immediately capitalized, with quarterback Trevor Siemian throwing an 11-yard touchdown to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Buccaneers' next drive, a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston tied the game, which would be the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game. Following another interception of Winston by Talib, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. With 3:25 remaining in the first half, Siemian injured his non-throwing shoulder when he was sacked by defensive tackle Clinton McDonald, and backup quarterback Paxton Lynch, the team's first-round draft selection, took over in his NFL debut. Placekicker Brandon McManus added two field goals&#8212;a 38-yarder just before halftime and a 24-yarder midway through the third quarter. Lynch later threw his first touchdown pass&#8212;a 5-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders&#8212;which put the game out of reach. At the 6:52 mark of the fourth quarter, the game was delayed for an hour and a half due to a severe weather threat in the Tampa area.Which player scored the first rushing touchdown?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which player scored the first rushing touchdown in the game described. I need to go through the text carefully and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that the Broncos visited Tampa Bay. Aqib Talib intercepted Jameis Winston early on, leading to a Broncos touchdown pass from Trevor Siemian to Demaryius Thomas. That's a passing touchdown, so not rushing. Then, on the Buccaneers' next drive, Jameis Winston had a 7-yard touchdown run. That's a rushing touchdown by Winston. Later, the Broncos got another touchdown with a 1-yard run by C.J. Anderson. So the first rushing touchdown would be Winston's, right? Because his run came after the initial passing TD by the Broncos. Let me check again. The order is: Broncos score first with a pass, then Buccaneers tie with a Winston rushing TD. Then another interception leads to Anderson's rushing TD. So yes, the first rushing touchdown was by Jameis Winston.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

In the first quarter, the Niners started off bumpy as Seahawks RB Shaun Alexander got a 3-yard TD run for Seattle's early strike and the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, San Francisco would get a field goal before halftime as kicker Joe Nedney nailed one from 39 yards out.  After a scorless third quarter, the Niners were in full force as QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to rookie TE Vernon Davis.  Afterwards, Smith would complete a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore.  Then, the 49ers wrapped the game up with Smith getting a very easy 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown.  Seattle would get one more score as QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 22-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens.  Fortunately, the Niners would get the win and the season sweep over the Seahawks.  With the win, the 49ers improved to 6-8How many yards longer was Alex Smith's longest touchdown pass than his shortest?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many yards longer Alex Smith's longest touchdown pass was compared to his shortest. So I need to find the longest and shortest touchdown passes he threw in the game and then subtract the shorter one from the longer one to get the difference.\n\nLooking at the text provided, let me go through the plays where Alex Smith threw touchdown passes. The game summary mentions that in the fourth quarter, after a scoreless third quarter, the 49ers were in full force. First, Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to Vernon Davis. Then, he threw a 20-yard TD pass to Frank Gore. Later, he had an 18-yard QB sneak for a touchdown. Wait, but a QB sneak is a rushing play, right? So that's a rushing touchdown, not a passing touchdown. The question specifically asks about touchdown passes, so the QB sneak probably doesn't count here. So the passing touchdowns are the 8-yard to Davis and the 20-yard to Gore. \n\nSo the two touchdown passes are 8 yards and 20 yards. The longest is 20, the shortest is 8. Subtracting 8 from 20 gives 12.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Cincinnati had a number of offensive weapons, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Wide receiver Eddie Brown (wide receiver) was the top receiver on the team, with 54 receptions for 1,273 yards and 9 touchdowns, setting franchise records for most receiving yards in season, highest yards per catch average in a season (24.0) and most receiving yards in a single game (216 against the Pittsburgh Steelers). Wide receiver Tim McGee and Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman were also major threats, combining for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns. Rookie fullback Ickey Woods was their top rusher with 1,066 yards and 15 touchdowns, while also catching 21 passes for 199 yards and gaining a lot of media attention with his \"Ickey Shuffle\", a dance routine he did in the end zone to celebrate his touchdowns. Multi-talented running back James Brooks (American football player) was also a key contributor, gaining a total of 1,218 combined rushing and receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. And the Bengals offensive line was led by such Pro Bowl players as right guard Max Montoya and left tackle Anthony Mu\u00f1oz. Mu\u00f1oz was named the NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 8th season in a row. With all these weapons, Cincinnatis offense led the NFL in scoring (448 points), rushing yards (2,710), and total yards (6,302).How many wide receives scored touchdowns?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many wide receivers scored touchdowns for Cincinnati based on the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the text and identify all the wide receivers mentioned and check how many touchdowns each scored. The text mentions several offensive players, so I need to focus on the wide receivers specifically.\n\nThe first player mentioned is Eddie Brown, who is a wide receiver. The text says he had 9 touchdowns. So that's one wide receiver with 9 TDs.\n\nNext, it mentions Tim McGee, another wide receiver. He's paired with Rodney Holman, who is a Pro Bowl tight end. The text states that McGee and Holman combined for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns. Wait, so together they have 9 touchdowns. But since Holman is a tight end, not a wide receiver, only McGee's touchdowns would count towards the wide receivers. However, the problem is that the combined touchdowns are 9, but we don't know how many each scored individually. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The question is asking for the number of wide receivers who scored touchdowns, not the total number of touchdowns by wide receivers. So if Tim McGee is a wide receiver and he scored at least one touchdown, then he counts as a second wide receiver. But if he didn't score any, then he wouldn't. But the text says they combined for 9 touchdowns. Since Holman is a tight end, maybe some of those touchdowns are his. But the problem is that the text doesn't specify how the 9 touchdowns are split between McGee and Holman. So we can't assume. Wait, but the question is asking how many wide receivers scored touchdowns, not how many touchdowns they scored. So if both McGee and Holman scored touchdowns, but Holman is a tight end, then only McGee would count as a wide receiver. But the text says \"wide receiver Tim McGee and Pro Bowl tight end Rodney Holman were also major threats, combining for 75 receptions, 1,213 yards, and 9 touchdowns.\" So the 9 touchdowns are from both of them. But since the question is about wide receivers, we need to know how many of those touchdowns were scored by McGee. However, the text doesn't specify. So maybe we have to assume that both McGee and Holman scored touchdowns, but since Holman is a tight end, only McGee is a wide receiver. But without knowing if McGee scored any, we can't be sure. Wait, but the question is about the number of wide receivers who scored, not the number of touchdowns. So even if McGee scored just one, he counts. But the text says they combined for 9 touchdowns. So unless all 9 were scored by Holman (unlikely), McGee must have scored some. Therefore, we can infer that Tim McGee, as a wide receiver, scored at least one touchdown.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "<think>\nEddie Brown is explicitly stated to have scored 9 touchdowns. Tim McGee is grouped with Rodney Holman, and together they scored 9 touchdowns.  While the exact split isn't given, it's highly improbable that McGee, a \"major threat\", scored zero touchdowns.  Therefore, we can reasonably infer that McGee scored at least one touchdown. Thus, we have two wide receivers who scored touchdowns: Eddie Brown and Tim McGee.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{2}\n",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Just days after teammate Sean Taylor died of his injuries, the Redskins tried to snap a three-game skid at home against the Buffalo Bills. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. For the team's first defensive play, they would come out with only 10 players on the field, as their honor to Taylor. In the first quarter, the Redskins took the early lead as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got on the board as linebacker Angelo Crowell sacked quarterback Jason Campbell in his end zone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half as Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills drew closer as kicker Rian Lindell managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Later, the Redskins responded with running back Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When the Bills tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved the Bills 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards. Afterwards, the Bills ended the game with Lindell nailing the game-winning 36-yard field goal.Who kicked the most number of field goals?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking who kicked the most number of field goals in the game described between the Redskins and the Bills, right after Sean Taylor's death. Alright, so I need to go through the text and count all the field goals made by each kicker.\n\nFirst, let's break down the game by quarters and note each kicker's field goals. The Redskins have Shaun Suisham as their kicker, and the Bills have Rian Lindell. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nIn the first quarter: Redskins took the early lead with a 27-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. That's one for Suisham.\n\nSecond quarter: Suisham kicks a 28-yard field goal, increasing their lead. That's his second. Then later in the second quarter, Suisham makes a 33-yard field goal. That's his third. So after the first half, Suisham has three field goals.\n\nThird quarter: Bills' Rian Lindell makes a 38-yard field goal. That's Lindell's first. Then the Redskins respond with a touchdown, so no field goal there. Later in the third, Lindell kicks a 43-yard field goal. That's his second. So after the third quarter, Lindell has two.\n\nFourth quarter: Lindell makes a 24-yard field goal. That's his third. Then another 33-yard field goal. Wait, the text says \"along with a 33-yard field goal.\" So that's his fourth. Then the Bills tried a 51-yard field goal, but the coach called timeout twice. After the penalty, they moved closer and Lindell made a 36-yard field goal. Wait, but the original 51-yard attempt was blocked or missed? No, the text says when they tried to kick again after the timeouts, but Gibbs called another timeout, leading to a penalty. Then Lindell ended up kicking a 36-yard field goal, which was the game-winner. So how many field goals did Lindell actually make in the fourth quarter?\n\nLet me parse that again. In the fourth quarter:\n\n- Lindell kicks a 24-yard field goal. (Third FG)\n- Then a 33-yard field goal. (Fourth FG)\n- Then they attempted a 51-yard FG, but after two timeouts and a penalty, they retried from 36 yards. So the 51-yard attempt was not counted because of the timeout, but the 36-yard was successful. So that's Lindell's fifth field goal.\n\nWait, but the text says: \"the Bills ended the game with Lindell nailing the game-winning 36-yard field goal.\" So that's the fifth field goal for Lindell.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLindell's field goals:\n\n1. 38-yard in the third quarter.\n2. 43-yard in the third quarter.\n3. 24-yard in the fourth.\n4. 33-yard in the fourth.\n5. 36-yard in the fourth (game-winner).\n\nSo that's five field goals for Lindell.\n\nSuisham's field goals:\n\n1. 27-yard in the first.\n2. 28-yard in the second.\n3. 33-yard in the second.\n\nThat's three field goals for Suisham.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

During the week leading up to the game, Bengals star wide receiver Chad Ochocinco said in an interview that he'll do a celebratory \"Lambeau Leap\" into the end zone seats if he scores in Sunday's game at Lambeau Field. The Packers started the contest with the ball, but could only manage to move the ball to mid field before they settled for a punt. The Bengals offense then took to the field at their own 37-yard line and after moving the ball into the Packers red zone, Carson Palmer managed to hit Laveranues Coles on a short 5-yard pass in the center of the end zone to take an early 7-0 lead. The Packers managed to match the Bengals drive though, by capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 3-yard pass by Aaron Rodgers to Donald Driver along the right sideline of the end zone. The score was now tied a 7-7. The Bengals regained possession after the Packers touchdown, but on the first play of their corresponding drive Carson Palmer attempted a pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco along the right sideline, but Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in front of Ochocinco and intercepted the attempted pass. Woodson then returned the ball down to the Bengals 11-yard line for a return of 22 yards. Two plays later, Packers running back Ryan Grant scored a touchdown on a 4-yard run outside of the left guard to take a 14-7 lead. After the Grant touchdown, both teams exchanged possessions into the second quarter. On the Bengals second drive after the Ryan Grant touchdown run, quarterback Carson Palmer capped the Bengals drive with a 1-yard sneak up the middle for a touchdown to re-tie the contest at 14-14. The Packers offense again sputtered and couldn't find the rhythm that the offense once possessed a season ago. After the punt, Carson Palmer was sacked for a loss of 8 yards and then on the next play Charles Woodson intercepted another pass along the right sideline from Palmer and returned the ball 37 yards for the Packers first defensive score of the season to retake the lead 21-14. On the Bengals next drive though, they would then retake the lead again on a 5-yard Palmer pass to Chris Henry in the back of the end zone. The score was now tied 21-21. The Packers offense retook the field aiming to break the tie before halftime, but only could manage to give kicker Mason Crosby a 55-yard attempt in which he missed as the clock expired. The teams went into the half tied at 21. After the half, the Bengals offense took to the field first but was forced to punt. The Packers responded by moving the ball quite efficiently, but their drive came to an end when Ryan Grant fumbled after pulling in a short Aaron Rodgers pass. The Bengals then managed to capitalize on the Packers first turn over of the season by putting together a 12-play, 62-yard drive capped by another Carson Palmer touchdown pass, this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. After the touchdown, Ochocinco ran behind the endzone looking for a place to Lambeau Leap finally settling for a group of Bengals fans in the right corner of the endzone. Both teams exchanged possession without scoring through the end of the third quarter. With both teams unable to score into the fourth quarter, the Bengals finally converted a field goal with 2 minutes left in game. to take a 31-21 lead. After the field goal, the Packers took over and managed to get the ball into field goal range in which Packers coach decided to kick the field goal to decrease the lead to 7 needing an onside kick recovery to tie the game anyway. The Mason Crosby kick was successful and the Packers special teams unit then lined up in the onside kick formation. Mason Crosby kicked the ball the right side and the ball hopped right to Packers corner back Tramon Williams for the recovery. With 45 seconds remaining, The Packers offense took the field with no timeouts. Rodgers then completed a couple of passes and moved the ball past midfield with 16 seconds remaining. Rodgers then completed a 25-yard strike to Donald Driver in the center of the field for 25 yards down to the Bengals 10-yard line. Hurrying down field the Packers snapped the ball with 1 second remaining but the Packers were flagged for a false start. With the penalty the remaining time was run off the clock and the game ended. What could have been a memorable comeback ended in defeat with the Packers suffering their first loss of the season 31-24 to bring their record to 1-1.

Hmm, the question is asking about the difference in yards between the first and second touchdowns. Let me go back through the text and find the details of each touchdown.\n\nFirst, the Packers' first touchdown: It says they capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 3-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers to Donald Driver. So that touchdown was a 3-yard pass. Got that.\n\nThen the second touchdown: After Charles Woodson's interception, the Packers had the ball at the Bengals' 11-yard line. Two plays later, Ryan Grant scored a 4-yard run. Wait, so the second touchdown was a 4-yard run. Wait, but the question is about the first touchdown versus the second. Wait, the first Packers touchdown was 3 yards, the second was 4 yards. But wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the first touchdown by the Packers was the 3-yard pass to Driver. Then after the interception, they scored again with Grant's 4-yard run. So the first touchdown was 3 yards, the second was 4 yards. Wait, but the question is asking how many yards longer the first was than the second. Wait, that would be 3 minus 4, which is negative, but maybe I'm mixing up which is first and second. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first touchdown in the game was by the Bengals: a 5-yard pass to Laveranues Coles. Then the Packers' first touchdown was the 3-yard pass. Then the Packers' second touchdown was the 4-yard run by Grant. Then the Bengals scored again, etc. Wait, but the question is about the first and second touchdowns in the game, or the first and second touchdowns by the Packers? The question says \"the first touchdown than the second\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the exact question again.\n\nThe exact question is: \"How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the second?\" So it's comparing the first touchdown (in the game) to the second touchdown (in the game). Let's see.\n\nThe first touchdown in the game was the Bengals' 5-yard pass to Coles. The second touchdown was the Packers' 3-yard pass to Driver. Wait, but the question is asking how many yards longer the first was than the second. So 5 yards (first) minus 3 yards (second) equals 2 yards. So the answer would be 2. But wait, maybe the question is referring to the Packers' first and second touchdowns. Let me check the context again.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: The user is asking about the Packers' touchdowns. Wait, the problem is in the context of the entire game, but the question is phrased generally. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe text describes the game between the Packers and Bengals. The user's question is: \"How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the second?\" Without any qualifiers, it's possible that it's referring to the first and second touchdowns in the game, regardless of the team. Let's recount the touchdowns in order.\n\n1. Bengals: 5-yard pass to Coles (7-0)\n2. Packers: 3-yard pass to Driver (7-7)\n3. Packers: 4-yard run by Grant (14-7)\n4. Bengals: 1-yard QB sneak by Palmer (14-14)\n5. Packers: 37-yard interception return by Woodson (21-14)\n6. Bengals: 5-yard pass to Henry (21-21)\n7. Bengals: Ochocinco's TD (28-21 after extra point, but the play was a pass from Palmer to Ochocinco, but the text doesn't specify the yards here. Wait, let me check that part again.\n\nWait, after the interception return by Woodson, the score was 21-14. Then the Bengals retake the lead with a 5-yard pass to Chris Henry, making it 21-21 (assuming they made the extra point). Then after halftime, the Bengals scored another TD with a pass to Ochocinco. Let me check that part:\n\n\"the Bengals then managed to capitalize... this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. After the touchdown...\" So that's another TD, but the text doesn't specify the yardage here. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the text says: \"capped by another Carson Palmer touchdown pass, this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco.\" But it doesn't mention the yards. Hmm. So maybe that's a missing detail. But the question is about the first and second touchdowns.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Coming off their close win over the Panthers the Saints flew to University of Phoenix Stadium for an NFC duel with the Cardinals. In the first quarter the Saints took the early lead as kicker John Carney nailed a 31-yard field goal, followed by QB Drew Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Cardinals replied with kicker Jay Feely making a 37-yard field goal, followed by OT Levi Brown recovering a fumble and returning it 2 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter the Saints fell behind when Feely got a 44-yard field goal, followed the 4th quarter by Feely's 29-yard field goal. Then FS Kerry Rhodes recovered a fumble and ran 27 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. Then the Saints replied with Brees making a 35-yard TD pass to WR Robert Meachem, but had more problems when Brees' pass was intercepted by CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and returned 28 yards to the end zone for a touchdown.How many more field goals did Jay Feely have compared to John Carney?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more field goals Jay Feely had compared to John Carney in the game described. Alright, so first I need to go through the text and count all the field goals each kicker made.\n\nStarting with the Saints' John Carney. The text says in the first quarter, the Saints took the early lead as kicker John Carney nailed a 31-yard field goal. That's one field goal for Carney. Then later, the Cardinals' Jay Feely made a 37-yard field goal. So that's one for Feely. Then in the third quarter, the Saints fell behind when Feely got a 44-yard field goal. That's Feely's second. Then in the fourth quarter, Feely made a 29-yard field goal. That's his third. So Feely has three field goals. \n\nWait, let me check again. The Cardinals' scoring plays: first quarter, Feely's 37-yard FG. Third quarter, Feely's 44-yard FG. Fourth quarter, Feely's 29-yard FG. So that's three field goals for Feely. \n\nJohn Carney only had the one in the first quarter. So the difference would be 3 (Feely) minus 1 (Carney) equals 2. So Jay Feely had two more field goals than John Carney. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no other field goals mentioned. The rest of the scoring plays are touchdowns. The Saints had Brees throwing a TD pass to Shockey, then the Cardinals had Levi Brown with a fumble return TD. Then later, Kerry Rhodes with a fumble return TD, then Saints' Brees to Meachem TD, and then Cardinals' interception return TD by Rodgers-Cromartie. All those are touchdowns, not field goals. \n\nSo yes, Feely has three field goals, Carney has one. The difference is 3-1=2.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Lions continued with their early lead as Kitna completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  Afterwards, the Raiders began to come back as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry, followed by RB LaMont Jordan getting a 12-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Detroit responded with Hanson kicking a 46-yard field goal, while Oakland took the lead with McCown completing a 7-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith.  However, as it seems to be for the Raiders, their lead wouldn't hold as the Lions scored 17 unanswered points (32-yard TD pass from Kitna to WR Shaun McDonald, Hanson getting a 23-yard field goal, and RB Tatum Bell getting a 14-yard TD run) to end the game.Which team had the most first half touchdowns?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which team had the most first half touchdowns in this Raiders vs. Lions game from 2007. The question is asking specifically about the first half, so I need to focus on the events that happened before halftime. Let me read through the text again carefully.\n\nThe game started with a scoreless first quarter. Then, the Raiders trailed early when Lions' QB Jon Kitna threw a 13-yard TD pass to Roy Williams. That's the first touchdown. Then, the Lions increased their lead before halftime with a 46-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. Wait, a field goal is three points, not a touchdown. So in the first half, the Lions scored one touchdown (the TD pass to Roy Williams) and a field goal. The Raiders, on the other hand, didn't score in the first quarter. Then in the second quarter, after the Lions' TD and field goal, the Raiders... Hmm, the text says \"Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams. Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal.\" So that's all the scoring in the first half. The Raiders didn't score any points in the first half? Because the next scoring mentioned is in the third quarter when the Lions scored another TD (Calvin Johnson), and then the Raiders started their comeback with McCown's TD pass to Ronald Curry and LaMont Jordan's TD run. But those are in the third quarter, which is after halftime. Then in the fourth quarter, more scoring happened. So, in the first half, the only touchdowns would be the Lions' first TD by Roy Williams. The Raiders didn't score any touchdowns in the first half.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Broncos played the Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game.  The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey.  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game. With this win the Broncos remained tied with the Chargers in the AFC West with a 6-2 record.How many yards difference was Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s touchdown pass compared to Jake Plummer 's first touchdown pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the yards difference between Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass and Jake Plummer's first touchdown pass. Alright, so first I need to find out how long each of those touchdown passes was and then subtract the smaller number from the larger one to get the difference.\n\nStarting with Jake Plummer's first touchdown pass. The text says: \"The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game.\" So that's straightforward. Plummer's first TD pass was 16 yards.\n\nNow, Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass. Let me look through the text. In the second quarter, it mentions: \"Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.\" So his first TD pass was 15 yards. Wait, but the question is just asking for his touchdown pass compared to Plummer's first. So I think we need to compare those two specific passes.\n\nSo Plummer's first TD was 16 yards, Roethlisberger's first TD pass was 15 yards. The difference would be 16 - 15 = 1 yard.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Looking to secure their third straight win and another division title, the Patriots returned home to face the 7-7 Jaguars. After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game. With the win, the Patriots secured their first division title since 2007 and posted a 10-5 record heading into the final week of the season.Which team was leading the game going into the 3rd quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which team was leading going into the third quarter based on the game description provided.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events quarter by quarter. The game starts with the Patriots receiving the opening kickoff. They have a drive that ends with a fumble at the 1-yard line, but then the Jaguars turn it over on downs. The Patriots then score a touchdown (7-0). Later, after an interception, the Patriots score another TD to make it 14-0 at the start of the second quarter. \n\nIn the second quarter, the Jaguars have some penalties and punts, while the Patriots add two more touchdowns: a 1-yard run by Morris (21-0) and a 6-yard reception by Moss (28-0). The half ends with the Jaguars punting again, so the score at halftime is 28-0 Patriots.\n\nThe third quarter starts with the Jaguars having a long drive that ends in an interception at the Patriots' 2-yard line. Then the Patriots drive 90 yards and score a TD at the start of the fourth quarter (35-0). \n\nThe question is asking which team was leading going into the third quarter.

This remains the most points in their franchise history they have scored in the first quarter while it remains the largest number of points the Bengals have allowed in the first quarter alone.  This streak of points stood at 24 straight as Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.  The Bengals finally got on the board as Gio Benard ran for a 1-yard touchdown making the score 24-7.  Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal to move his team ahead 27-7 at halftime.  After this, the Steelers went back to work in the 3rd quarter coming away with another field goal from 26 yards out for a 30-7 lead.

There were 74,815 households, 21.3% of which had children under 18 living in them. 27.7% were married couples living together, 14.4% had a female householder with no husband, and 53.7% were non-families. 34.1% of all households were made up of individuals living alone and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.88. Children under the age of 5 were 5.5% of the population, persons under 18 were 17.2%, and persons 65 years or older were 8.1%. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males. 57.4% of the population was White, 35.0% Black, 3.7% Asian, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.3% some other race, and 2.3% two or more races. 6.3% were Hispanic or Latino of any race, and 53.3% were non-Hispanic White. For the period 2009\u20132013, the estimated median household income was $39,524, and the per capita income was $23,778. The number of persons below the poverty level was estimated at 30.2%.Were there more males or females in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking whether there were more males or females in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the text to find the relevant information. Let me scan through the numbers given. \n\nAh, here it is: \"For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males.\" So that ratio is 89.5 males per 100 females. Hmm. That means there are fewer males than females, right? Because if you have 100 females, you only have 89.5 males. So, for example, if there were 100 females, there would be 89.5 males. Therefore, females outnumber males. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The ratio is given as males per 100 females. So a number less than 100 would indicate fewer males. If it were more than 100, there would be more males. Since it's 89.5, that's less than 100, so females are more numerous. \n\nBut let me cross-check. The next sentence says, \"For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males.\" That's even lower, but the first ratio is for the entire population. The question is about the total population, not just adults. So the first ratio (89.5 males per 100 females) applies to all ages. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are more females than males in Tallahassee as of the 2010 census. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The population is 181,376. Let's verify with actual numbers. If the ratio is 89.5 males per 100 females, then the total population would be males + females. Let's denote females as F and males as M. \n\nGiven M/F = 89.5/100 = 0.895. So M = 0.895F. \n\nTotal population = M + F = 0.895F + F = 1.895F = 181,376. \n\nSo F = 181,376 / 1.895 \u2248 Let's calculate that. \n\nDividing 181,376 by 1.895. Let me approximate. 1.895 is roughly 1.9. 181,376 divided by 1.9. Let's see: 1.9 * 95,000 = 180,500. So 1.9 * 95,000 = 180,500. Then 181,376 - 180,500 = 876. So 95,000 + (876 / 1.9) \u2248 95,000 + 461 \u2248 95,461 females. \n\nThen males would be 0.895 * 95,461 \u2248 85,437. \n\nSo total would be 95,461 + 85,437 \u2248 180,898. Hmm, which is close to 181,376, considering rounding. So the actual numbers would have females around 95,000 and males around 85,000. Therefore, more females.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

So, the question is asking about the halftime lead. Let me read through the text again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe text says that after their win over the Eagles, the Giants stayed home for a Monday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals were coming back from London after a tie against the Redskins. At halftime, Tom Coughlin, Justin Tuck, and Ernie Accorsi were inducted into the Giants Ring of Honor, and the Giants were \"nursing a 14-10 lead.\" Then, the Bengals quickly got 10 points and had a 6-point lead going into the 4th quarter. Later, Sterling Shepard caught a touchdown on 4th and Goal to give the Giants a 21-20 lead. Their defense held on, and the Giants won, improving to 6-3.\n\nSo, the key part here is the halftime lead. The text explicitly states that at halftime, the Giants were \"nursing a 14-10 lead.\" The term \"nursing\" here probably means they were holding onto a narrow lead. So the score at halftime was Giants 14, Bengals 10.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean uprising  in 1917 has been described as  the \"largest and most destructive\" anti-colonial rebellion in French Indochina between the Pacification of Tonkin in the 1880s and the Nghe-Tinh Revolt of 1930-31. On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region.  The rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards. The initial success of the rebels was short-lived.  They managed to control the prison and the town's administrative buildings for six days, but were all expelled on the seventh day by French government reinforcements. According to French reports 107 were killed on the colonial side and fifty-six on the anti-colonial, including Quyen. French forces were not able to pacify the surrounding countryside until six months later. Can reportedly committed suicide in January 1918 to avoid capture. Both Quyen and Can have since been accorded legendary status as nationalist heroes.How many rebels mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many rebels mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary based on the given text. The question is asking for the number of rebels involved in the mutiny.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text again to make sure I don't miss any details. The relevant part says: \"the rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards.\" \n\nSo, breaking that down, there are three groups mentioned here: civilians, ex-prisoners, and prison guards. The numbers given are 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners, and 130 prison guards. The question is asking for the total number of rebels. So, I need to add these three numbers together.\n\nLet me check the math: 300 + 200 is 500, and then adding 130 gives 630. So the total number would be 630 rebels. \n\nWait, but the text says \"involved at some point roughly\" these numbers. Does that mean that the total number fluctuated, or that these are cumulative numbers over the course of the rebellion? The question specifically asks how many rebels mutinied, which I think refers to the participants in the mutiny itself. The initial mutiny would involve those present at the start, but the text mentions \"at some point,\" which might include people who joined later. However, since the question is about the mutiny at the penitentiary, which was the starting point, maybe the numbers given are the total participants during the event. \n\nBut the answer is likely the sum of those three groups: 300 + 200 + 130 = 630. Let me double-check if there's any other mention of numbers. The text also says that French reports mention 107 killed on the colonial side and 56 on the anti-colonial side, but those are casualties, not the total number of rebels. The initial mutiny numbers are the 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners, and 130 guards. So adding those gives 630. \n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Trying to break a two-game losing streak the Panthers flew to Raymond James Stadium for an NFC South rivalry match against the Buccaneers. In the 1st quarter the Panthers trailed early as QB Josh Freeman made an 8-yard TD pass to WR Arrelious Benn. They narrowed the lead with kicker John Kasay hitting a 46-yard field goal. They struggled further in the second quarter with RB LeGarrette Blount getting a 17-yard TD run; but they replied with RB Josh Vaughan making a 2-yard TD run. Tampa Bay scored again when Freeman found TE Kellen Winslow on a 20-yard TD pass. The Panthers tried to cut the lead down with Kasay's 28- and 48-yard field goals, but the Buccaneers pulled away in the fourth quarter with kicker Connor Barth nailing a 32-yard field goal, and with RB Cadillac Williams getting a 45-yard TD run.Who scored first\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking who scored first in the game between the Panthers and the Buccaneers. The text provided gives a summary of the game's scoring plays.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through the text and identify all the scoring events in chronological order. The game is divided into quarters, so I'll start by looking at the first quarter. The first sentence after setting up the game mentions that in the 1st quarter, the Panthers trailed early as QB Josh Freeman made an 8-yard TD pass to WR Arrelious Benn. That seems like the first score. Then the Panthers narrowed the lead with a field goal by Kasay. \n\nWait, so the Buccaneers scored first with that TD pass from Freeman to Benn. Then the Panthers responded with a field goal. The rest of the quarters have more scoring, but the first one is in the 1st quarter by the Buccaneers. The answer should be Josh Freeman and Arrelious Benn, but the question is phrased as \"who scored first,\" so probably the team or the player. Since it's a TD pass, the scoring play is a touchdown by the Buccaneers. The scorer would be Arrelious Benn, the receiver who caught the TD pass. Alternatively, sometimes people might say the quarterback threw the TD, but in terms of who actually scored the points, it's the receiver. But the question is about who scored first, so the answer is the Buccaneers' player who scored the TD. So the answer is Arrelious Benn. Let me check again. The first scoring play is Josh Freeman's 8-yard TD pass to Arrelious Benn. So Benn scored the first touchdown, hence the first points.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The failure of the \u015eark\u00f6y-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianople's fate. On 11 March after a two weeks' bombardment which destroyed many of the fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General Nikola Ivanov, the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the modern Turkish General Staff History notes that 28,500 man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured . Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the fortress would have fallen eventually due to starvation. The most important result was that now the Ottoman command lost all hopes of regaining the initiative, which made any further fighting pointless.How many men does the Turkish General Staff History say survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many men the Turkish General Staff History says survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text carefully. The relevant part is here: \"the modern Turkish General Staff History notes that 28,500 man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured.\" So, the Turkish source says that 28,500 survived captivity. The \"leaving only 10,000 unaccounted for\" part means that those 10,000 are separate from the 28,500. The question is asking for the number who survived captivity, which is 28,500. The unaccounted for (10,000) are possibly captured, but the question specifically asks for those who survived captivity. So the answer should be 28,500. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal numbers: Ottoman Empire started with 61,250 men. Richard Hall says 60,000 captured. Turkish source says 33,000 killed, 28,500 survived captivity, leaving 10,000 unaccounted. So total would be 33k killed + 28.5k survived captivity + 10k unaccounted = 71,500. But original number was 61,250. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the 33k killed is for the entire campaign? Let me check again.\n\nThe text says: \"Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the modern Turkish General Staff History notes that 28,500 man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured.\"\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The initial statement says Ottoman casualties (killed) were 23,000, but the Turkish source says 33,000 killed. Maybe that's a typo or different accounting. Let me parse this again.\n\nOriginal text:\n\n- Ottoman casualties (entire campaign): 23,000 killed.\n\n- Prisoners: unclear. Ottoman started with 61,250.\n\n- Richard Hall: 60,000 captured.\n\n- Turkish General Staff: 33,000 killed, 28,500 survived captivity, leaving 10,000 unaccounted (possibly captured).\n\nWait, so the Turkish source is saying total killed is 33,000 (which is higher than the 23k mentioned earlier). Then 28,500 survived captivity, and 10k unaccounted. So total would be 33k + 28.5k + 10k = 71,500. But original number was 61,250. That's a problem. Maybe the 33k killed includes other casualties? Or perhaps the numbers are being conflated between different sources. The question is specifically about the Turkish General Staff's numbers. The question is asking: How many men does the Turkish General Staff History say survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for?\n\nWait, the phrasing is a bit confusing. The Turkish source says that 28,500 survived captivity, and 10,000 were unaccounted for. The question is asking for the number that survived captivity (28,500) in addition to the unaccounted (10,000). Wait, no. The question says \"in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for\". Wait, maybe it's asking for the number of survivors plus the unaccounted? But the wording is \"survived captivity in addition to the men that were unaccounted\". No, the question is phrased as: \"how many men does the Turkish General Staff History say survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for?\" So, perhaps it's the number of survivors (28,500) plus the unaccounted (10,000), totaling 38,500? But that seems off. Wait, the question is asking for the number of men who survived captivity (28,500) and then, in addition to that, how many were unaccounted for (10,000). But the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me read the question again:\n\n\"How many men does the Turkish General Staff History say survived captivity in addition to the men that were ultimately unaccounted for?\"\n\nSo, the Turkish source says that 28,500 survived captivity, and 10,000 were unaccounted for. The question is asking for the number of survivors (28,500) plus the unaccounted (10,000)? Or is it asking for just the survivors (28,500\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Regaining power from military officials with the support of the Mongols, the king decided to abolish the Sambyeolcho . Resentful of the peace terms worked out with the Mongols, the Sambyeolcho, led by Bae Jungson , revolted against the government. Systematically blocking passage between Gangwha and the mainland, they brought nearby islands and coastal regions under their domain. Wang On, a royal kinsman was proclaimed king of the maritime kingdom. They gave up Ganghwa Island and fled to Jindo Island in the southwest. Although the Sambyeolcho raided the coastlines of Jeolla Province, the southwestern province, Jin Island started to face food shortages in January 1271. In February the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender. In response, its leader, Bae Jungson, asked Kublai Khan to secure Jeolla Province and put it under the direct rule of the empire, just as preceding rebels had. But his request was never fulfilled. In April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels. It only took a month until Jin Island fell to a combined Goryeo and Mongol army. The puppet king was killed and the survivors, led by Kim Tongjeong , fled to Jeju Island. The rebels captured the island and banished the king of Tamna in November 1270. The Sambyeolcho laid low until the end of 1271. During that time, they sought help from Japanese Kamakura Shogunate. They regained their strength to some degree the following year. They repeatedly looted the Korean coast. A combined Goryeo-Mongol assault began in February 1272, and crushed the rebels in April. Thereafter, the Mongols directly controlled Tamna until 1294.How many months was it in between the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender and the Yuan court deciding to crush the rebels?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many months passed between when the Yuan court called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender and when they decided to crush the rebels. \n\nFirst, I need to find the dates mentioned in the text. Let me read through the text again to pinpoint the key events.\n\nThe text says: \"In February the court of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho's surrender. ... In April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels.\"\n\nSo, the surrender demand was in February 1271, and the decision to crush them was in April 1271. Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of months between these two events. \n\nWait, February to April. Let me count the months. From February to March is one month, and then March to April is another. But if the surrender call was in February and the decision was in April, that's two months apart. But wait, the exact dates might matter. If the surrender was in February and the decision was in April of the same year, then the time between is two months. But sometimes, depending on the days, it could be a bit different. However, since the problem is asking for months, not days, we can just count the number of months between the two events.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The text says: \"In February... called for surrender. ... In April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels.\" So February to April. Let's see: February to March is one month, March to April is another. So that's two months. But wait, if the surrender was in February and the decision was in April, the time between is from the end of February to the beginning of April, which is about 1 month and a few days. But since the question is about months in between, maybe it's counted as two months. Hmm, but sometimes when counting inclusive or exclusive, but in this case, the events are in different months. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is two months. Because from February to April, that's two months later. For example, if it's February 1st to April 1st, that's exactly two months. If the decision was made in April, regardless of the day, the difference in months is two. So the answer would be two months. But let me check the text again to confirm the years. The surrender was in February 1271, and the decision to crush was in April 1271. So same year. So the months between are February, March, April. Wait, from February to April, how many months in between? If you count the start month as month 0, then from February to March is 1 month, and March to April is another, so total two months.

Detroit finally got on the board with two consecutive field goals by Jason Hanson, from 29 and 35 yards out respectively. After halftime, the Bears defense intercepted Lions QB Matthew Stafford twice for touchdowns. First, Major Wright caught one and ran it in 24 yards. Then Charles Tillman completed a 44-yard pick 6.

Alright, so first, I need to parse through the text and find all instances where field goals were made, then sum up the yards for each of those field goals.\n\nLooking at the text: \n\nIn the first part, after the Ravens' early touchdown, the Jets respond with a kickoff return. Then, Baltimore regains the lead with kicker Billy Cundiff making a 38-yard field goal. Then later in the second quarter, Cundiff makes another 38-yard field goal. The Jets' kicker Nick Folk makes a 40-yard field goal. So that's three field goals in total.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst quarter: Ravens (Cundiff) 38-yard FG. Second quarter: Ravens (Cundiff) another 38-yard FG. Then Jets (Folk) 40-yard FG. Third quarter and beyond, the Ravens score a TD via interception return, but no more field goals mentioned. So total three field goals: two by Cundiff (38 and 38) and one by Folk (40). So adding those up: 38 + 38 + 40. Let me do the math. 38 + 38 is 76, plus 40 is 116. So total yards from field goals would be 116 yards. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, in football, when a kicker makes a field goal, the yardage is the distance of the kick, not the total yards from the line of scrimmage to the end zone. Wait, but actually, the field goal yardage is the distance from where the ball is kicked. So if the kick is 38 yards, that's the actual yards the ball traveled. So each field goal's yardage is as listed. So adding them up as 38 + 38 + 40 = 116. So the answer should be 116. \n\nBut let me make sure there are no other field goals mentioned. The text says: Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff got a 38-yard FG, then another 38-yard FG in the second quarter. Then Jets' Nick Folk a 40-yard FG. Then in the third quarter, Ravens score a TD via interception return. No other field goals. So three field goals total. So 38 + 38 + 40 = 116. So the answer is 116. \n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Sometimes people get confused between the length of the field goal and the total yards. But in the context here, the question is \"total yards made by field goal in the game,\" which would be the sum of each field goal's distance. So yes, each of those three kicks: 38, 38, 40. Sum them. 38+38=76, 76+40=116. So 116 yards total.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1783, the Cataraqui region was selected by the British as a location to settle United Empire Loyalists who had fled the United States after the American War of Independence. The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks.  During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops. Many of the present barrack buildings were built between 1821 and 1824.How many more men than officers worked on the building of the fort?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more men than officers worked on the building of the fort. The text mentions that there was a force of 422 men and 25 officers. So, I need to find the difference between the number of men and officers.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the numbers: 422 men and 25 officers. To find how many more men there are compared to officers, I subtract the number of officers from the number of men. That would be 422 minus 25. Let me do the calculation. \n\n422 minus 20 is 402, and then subtract 5 more, which gives 397. So, there are 397 more men than officers. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. The problem states 422 men and 25 officers, so yes, subtracting 25 from 422 gives 397. That seems right. I don't think there's any trick here; it's a straightforward subtraction problem. The other details in the text about the fort's history probably aren't relevant to this particular question. Just focusing on the numbers provided for the workforce.\n</think>\n\nThe number of men is 422 and the number of officers is 25. To find how many more men than officers there were, subtract the number of officers from the number of men:  \n422 men - 25 officers = 397.  \n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori. Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed; however, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two Russian lookout stations remained near Poti. On 13 September, Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned. Withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi also took place.

Russia continued to maintain a single checkpoint in the border village of Perevi. On 12 December, Russian forces withdrew; eight hours later they re-entered the village and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire. Russian forces then set up three checkpoints in the village. On 18 October 2010 all Russian troops in Perevi withdrew to South Ossetia and a Georgian Army unit moved in.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Regent Moray and his secretary John Wood tried to gain English support by producing the Casket letters in England, which were intended to incriminate Mary in the death of Lord Darnley. Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \"Captain General.\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war.Which two Queens are mentioned?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which two Queens are mentioned in the provided text. I need to read through the text carefully and identify any queens mentioned.\n\nStarting from the beginning: The first sentence mentions Regent Moray and John Wood trying to gain English support by producing the Casket letters to incriminate Mary in Lord Darnley's death. So here, \"Mary\" is mentioned. Since the context is historical, Mary likely refers to Mary, Queen of Scots. \n\nThen, the text says Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were reluctant to intervene but their actions supported Moray. So Queen Elizabeth is definitely one of the queens mentioned. \n\nFurther down, there's mention of the Marian lords, which probably refers to supporters of Mary. The text also talks about Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle and her reputation being damaged by the Ridolfi plot. \n\nSo putting it together, the two queens mentioned are Mary (Queen of Scots) and Queen Elizabeth I of England. The text doesn't mention any other queens besides these two. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other queen named.

            "question": "Given the question statement:James Douglas was the second son of Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, Master of Angus, and Elizabeth Douglas, daughter David Douglas of Pittendreich. He wrote that he was over 61 years old in March 1578, so was probably born around 1516. Before 1543 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Morton. In 1553 James Douglas succeeded to the title and estates of his father-in-law, including Dalkeith House in Midlothian, and Aberdour Castle in Fife. Elizabeth Douglas and her two elder sisters, who were married to Regent Arran and Lord Maxwell, suffered from mental ill-health. Their children either did not survive to adulthood, or in the case of three daughters were declared legally incompetent in 1581. James also had five illegitimate children At the start of war of the Rough Wooing, James and his brother David communicated with Henry VIII of England on the possibility of their surrendering Tantallon Castle to the English army that burnt Edinburgh in 1544. However, four years later he defended Dalkeith Palace against the English and was captured in June 1548, \"sore hurt on the thigh \" and taken as a hostage to England. After the Treaty of Boulogne brought peace, in 1550 James returned from captivity in England and was exchanged for the English soldier John Luttrell, and began to use his title of \"Earl of Morton.\" In 1559 James's political activities and allegiances during the Scottish Reformation were at first equivocal, but in February 1560 he signed the Treaty of Berwick which invited an English army into Scotland to expel the Catholic regime of Mary of Guise. He took part in the unsuccessful embassy to England in November 1560 to treat for the marriage of Elizabeth I of England to James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran.Who was born first: Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich or James Douglas?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out who was born first between Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich and James Douglas. The text provided is about James Douglas, so I need to look for clues about their birth years.\n\nThe text says that James Douglas wrote he was over 61 years old in March 1578, so he was probably born around 1516. That gives James's birth year as approximately 1516. \n\nNow, Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich is mentioned as James's father. The question is asking who was born first, the father or the son. Typically, a father is older than his son, so Sir George would have been born before James. But I should check if there's any information in the text that might suggest otherwise, just to be sure.\n\nLooking through the text again, there's no mention of Sir George's birth date. However, since he is the father of James, it's logical that Sir George was born earlier. Unless there's some unusual circumstance, like Sir George being a younger father, but that's not indicated here. The text does mention that James was the second son of Sir George, so Sir George had at least two sons, with James being the second.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The question is about the opening ceremony tickets' availability to the general public and when they sold out.\n\nFrom the text: \"Priced between S$5 to S$20, priority sales for the opening and closing ceremonies tickets for those who registered their interests in 2014 began on 15 January 2015, while sales for the general public began on 22 January 2015.\" So the general public sales started on 22 January 2015.\n\nThen it says, \"In February 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were going at over seven times their original value on unauthorised websites, despite 40% of the tickets still available at that time. By March 2015, tickets to the opening ceremony were sold out.\" So by March 2015, they were sold out. \n\nWait, but when exactly in March? The text doesn't specify a date in March, just says \"by March 2015\". So we need to figure out the duration from when general sales started (22 Jan) until when they were sold out (sometime in March). \n\nBut how to calculate the months here? If sales started on 22 Jan and ended in March, even if it's sold out on 1 March, that's still part of March. So from 22 Jan to 1 March is about 1 month and 8 days. But the question is asking for how many months were they available before being sold out. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 2 months? Let's check the timeline again. \n\nGeneral sales started on 22 January. Then in February, tickets were still available (40% left), and by March, they were sold out. So from 22 January to the end of February is about 1 month and 1 week. But if they sold out in March, then the tickets were available in January (from 22nd), February, and part of March. But the problem is that the exact date in March when they sold out isn't given. The text just says \"By March 2015, tickets... were sold out.\" So maybe they were sold out by the start of March? But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 2 months: January and February. Because even though sales started on 22 Jan, January is counted as a partial month, and then February is a full month. But if they sold out in March, then it's 2 months (Jan and Feb) plus part of March. But the problem is that the question is phrased as \"for how many months were opening ceremony tickets available to the general public before being sold out?\" So maybe we need to count the number of full months. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 month and 1 week, but since the question asks for months, maybe rounded to 2 months? Hmm. Wait, let's check the exact timeline again. \n\nSales to the general public began on 22 January 2015. Then in February 2015, tickets were still on sale (with 40% available). By March 2015, they were sold out. So the tickets were available from 22 Jan to some time in March. But how many months is that? \n\nIf we count from 22 Jan to 22 Feb: that's one month. Then from 22 Feb to the date they sold out in March. If they sold out on, say, 1 March, that's only a few days into March. But the problem is that the exact date isn't given. The text says \"by March 2015\", which could mean that as of March, they were sold out. So maybe they were sold out by 1 March. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the tickets were available until the end of February, but the text says that in February, 40% were still available, and then by March, they were sold out. So between February and March, they sold the remaining 40%. But the exact time isn't specified. \n\nWait, the problem is that the answer might be from 22 Jan to March (when sold out). If we consider the months they were on sale: part of January, all of February, and part of March. But how to convert that into months. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many months were opening ceremony tickets available to the general public before being sold out?\" So perhaps the answer is 2 months: January and February.

The Vikes got off to a fast start as Blair Walsh nailed a 54-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead followed up by Matt Cassel hooking up with Greg Jennings on a 70-yard touchdown pass for a 10-0 lead.  The Steelers managed to get on the board later on in the first quarter when rookie RB Le'Von Bell ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the game 10-7.  The Vikes moved ahead by double digits in the second quarter as Adrian Peterson ran for a 60-yard touchdown for a 17-7 lead.  Shaun Suisham got the Steelers within a touchdown by nailing a 26-yard field goal for a 17-10 lead.  Walsh moved the Vikes ahead by 10 at halftime by kicking a 37-yard field goal for a 20-10 lead.  The Steelers came within 3 as Le'Von Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown shortening the lead to 20-17 but the Vikes managed to move ahead 27-17 after Peterson ran for a 7-yard touchdown and then Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make the lead 34-17.  In the 4th quarter, Jerricho Cotchery hooked up with Ben Roethlisberger on a 15-yard touchdown pass for a 34-24 lead, and then tried to rally as Suisham nailed a 28-yard field goal.  The Steelers' comeback attempt was ruined again as Roethlisberger was sacked and fumbled the ball with less than a minute left in the game sealing the victory for the Vikes. With this loss, the Steelers are off to their worst start since the AFL-NFL merger. They had last started 0-4 in 1968, when they started 0-6.  This is also the first time since 2006 in which the team would fall to 4 games below .500 when they started that season 2-6.What country was this game between the Vikings and Steelers played in?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which country the game between the Vikings and Steelers was played in. The text provided gives a detailed account of the game. Let me read through it again to find the relevant information.\n\nThe first sentence says, \"The Steelers traveled to London, England and were considered the visitor team against a Matt Cassel-led Vikings team.\" So right there, it mentions London, England. That seems like the key detail. The rest of the text talks about the game's progression, the scores, and some historical context about the Steelers' performance. But the country where the game was played is explicitly stated in the first sentence as London, England. Since London is in the United Kingdom, but the answer here is probably just England. Wait, but countries are usually referred to as the sovereign state. The United Kingdom is the country, while England is a constituent country within it. However, in common parlance, especially in sports contexts, they might just say the country as England. Let me check if there's any other mention. The rest of the text doesn't mention any other country. The Vikings are based in Minnesota, USA, and the Steelers are from Pittsburgh, USA. But the game was in London, England. So the answer should be England. But wait, the UK is the country. Hmm. This might be a point of confusion. Let me think. When NFL games are played in London, they are considered international games, and the country is the United Kingdom. But the text specifically says London, England. So maybe the answer is England. However, technically, the United Kingdom is the country. But maybe the question is expecting England as the answer because that's how it's phrased in the text. Let me check the exact wording again. The first sentence: \"The Steelers traveled to London, England and were considered the visitor team...\" So they specify London, England.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "<think>It's tricky, but given the text explicitly states \"London, England,\" and the question asks \"What *country* was this game played in?\", the most appropriate answer, considering the context, is England. While technically the UK is the sovereign state, the text emphasizes England.  It's a subtle distinction, but the phrasing of the question and the provided text point towards England as the intended answer.</think>\n\n\\boxed{England}\n",

            "question": "Given the question statement:The Raiders made it to their fourth Super Bowl in team history after posting a 12-4 regular season record. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed 230 out of 379 (60.7 percent) passes resulting in 2,935 yards and 20 touchdowns.  His favorite target was tight end Todd Christensen, who led the NFL with 92 receptions for 1,247 yards and 12 touchdowns. Wide receivers Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell combined for 74 receptions, 1,209 yards, and 6 touchdowns. But the largest impact on offense was running back Marcus Allen. In just his second NFL season, Allen led the team in rushing yards (1,014) and total yards from scrimmage (1,604), while ranking second on the team in receptions (68) and touchdowns (11). But Allen was not the only key running back on the team. Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined for 1,119 total rushing and receiving yards, and 10 touchdowns.  Los Angeles also had a powerful special teams attack led by Greg Pruitt, who led the NFL in punt returns (58), and punt return yards (666), while adding another 604 yards returning kickoffs and rushing for 154 yards and two scores.Which players mentioned are running backs?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which players mentioned in the text are running backs. I need to go through the text carefully and identify each player's position as mentioned.\n\nFirst, the text starts by talking about the Raiders making it to the Super Bowl. Then it mentions their quarterback, Jim Plunkett. So he's a quarterback, not a running back. His favorite target is tight end Todd Christensen. So Todd is a tight end. Then there are wide receivers Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell. So those two are wide receivers, not running backs.\n\nNext, the text says the largest impact on offense was running back Marcus Allen. Here, Marcus Allen is explicitly called a running back. Then it mentions that Allen was in his second NFL season and led the team in rushing yards and total yards from scrimmage. So that's one running back.\n\nThen it says, \"But Allen was not the only key running back on the team. Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined for...\" So here, Kenny King is specified as a running back in parentheses. Then Frank Hawkins is mentioned next, but his position isn't given here. Wait, but the sentence structure says \"Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined...\" So does that mean Frank Hawkins is also a running back? The way it's phrased, \"But Allen was not the only key running back on the team. Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined...\" It seems like both Kenny King and Frank Hawkins are running backs. Because the first part says Allen wasn't the only one, then lists two players, with one explicitly labeled as a running back, and the other is part of the same positional group. So maybe Frank Hawkins is also a running back.\n\nThen later, the text mentions Greg Pruitt, who led the NFL in punt returns and kickoff returns. He's part of the special teams. The text says he added another 604 yards returning kickoffs and rushing for 154 yards and two scores. But his position isn't explicitly stated here. Wait, but the question is about which players are mentioned as running backs. Greg Pruitt's role here is as a return specialist, but he also had some rushing yards. However, unless the text explicitly calls him a running back, I shouldn't assume. The text says \"Los Angeles also had a powerful special teams attack led by Greg Pruitt...\" So he's part of special teams. The fact that he rushed for some yards doesn't necessarily make him a running back; he could be a returner who occasionally takes handoffs. So unless the text says he's a running back, I shouldn't include him.\n\nSo, to recap: Marcus Allen is a running back. Kenny King is explicitly called a running back. Frank Hawkins is mentioned alongside Kenny King in the context of being running backs, given the previous sentence stating Allen wasn't the only one. So Frank Hawkins is likely a running back as well. Greg Pruitt is part of special teams, not labeled as a running back. The other players mentioned (Jim Plunkett, Todd Christensen, Cliff Branch, Malcolm Barnwell) are in other positions.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Facing a desperate season verging on the point of disaster yet again, the Browns traveled again in Week 10 to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta to meet the Atlanta Falcons. The 5-3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7-0 lead. The second quarter started with a bang for the Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback Michael Vick threw an interception to Browns safety Sean Jones. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26. However, Falcons kicker Morten Andersen kicked a 44-yard field goal to get on the board 14-3 at halftime Very little happened in the third quarter. Michael Vick was driving in Cleveland territory with 5:28 remaining when he was intercepted again by Browns safety Brodney Pool. However, the ensuing Browns possession resulted in a Dave Zastudil punt. The punt was out of their own endzone and was returned to the Browns 12. It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. The possibility of success seemed unlikely for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained favorable field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal.  At that point the Browns were leading 14-13. The next drive for the Browns looked promising. After two passes to tight end Steve Heiden and a 36-yard pass to Kellen Winslow, the Browns then faltered and had to settle for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal. The score was 17-13. With 3:18 remaining in the game, Atlanta took over on their own 28-yard line. Down by 4, Vick let in loose downfield to an open receiver Roddy White for a 55-yard gain. The Falcons then committed a 10-yard penalty and Vick threw an incomplete pass. With 2nd and 20 on the Cleveland 27, Vick fumbled the ball on 3rd down to a waiting Browns rookie cornerback Jereme Perry. Out of timeouts, the Falcons fell for a second week in a row to the Browns.How many points did Cleveland win by?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many points the Cleveland Browns won by in this game against the Atlanta Falcons. I need to go through the text step by step and track the scoring plays for each team.\n\nStarting with the first quarter: The Browns scored a touchdown with a run by Reuben Droughns. A touchdown is worth 6 points, and assuming they made the extra point, that's 7 points. So Cleveland 7, Atlanta 0.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Browns scored another touchdown with a 19-yard pass from Charlie Frye to Braylon Edwards. Another 7 points (6 for the TD + 1 extra point), making it 14-0. Then, the Falcons kicked a 44-yard field goal by Morten Andersen. A field goal is 3 points, so the score at halftime is 14-3.\n\nThird quarter: The Falcons scored a touchdown with a pass from Vick to Michael Jenkins. That's 6 points plus the extra point, so 7 points. The score becomes 14-10 (Cleveland still leading).\n\nFourth quarter: Falcons kick another field goal, this time 46 yards, adding 3 points. Now the score is 14-13. Then the Browns kick a 43-yard field goal by Phil Dawson, adding 3 points. So now it's 17-13 Cleveland. \n\nAt the end of the game, Atlanta tries to come back but fumbles, and Cleveland takes over. The final score remains 17-13. \n\nSo the difference is 17 minus 13, which is 4 points.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Fran\u00e7ois, Madeleine's father, died on 16 February 1700, and his pension of 1000 livres was transferred to Madeleine due to her leadership in 1692, on the condition that she provide for her mother. Madeleine managed Verch\u00e8res until her marriage in September 1706 to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu de La P\u00e9rade, who was a lieutenant in the regular troops of New France.  He was the son of Thomas de Lanougu\u00e8re, an administrator of the colony who descended from an old noble family in France.  The couple moved to Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade, Quebec, where Tarieu was co-seigneur.  Madeleine's seigneury at Verch\u00e8res was transferred to her new husband.  The complex land titles led to numerous lawsuits over the course of her life, and Madeleine sailed to France at least three times to represent herself and her husband in court. Marie-Madeleine died at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade on 8 August 1747 at age 69.  She was buried beneath her pew at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade.  Pierre-Thomas died 26 January 1757 at age 79.How many years after Fran\u00e7ois' death did Marie-Madeleine get married?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many years after Fran\u00e7ois' death did Marie-Madeleine get married.\n\nFirst, I need to find the dates of Fran\u00e7ois' death and Marie-Madeleine's marriage. From the text, Fran\u00e7ois died on 16 February 1700. Then, Madeleine got married in September 1706. So, the time between February 1700 and September 1706. \n\nWait, but how do we calculate the years here? Let's subtract 1700 from 1706, which gives 6 years. But since Fran\u00e7ois died in February and she married in September, there's a period of about 6 years and 7 months. However, when counting the number of years after his death, even if it's not a full year, sometimes they just count the difference in the years. But let me check if there's a specific way they want it calculated here.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of years after Fran\u00e7ois' death. So from February 1700 to February 1706 would be exactly 6 years. Then from February 1706 to September 1706 is an additional 7 months. But since the marriage happened in 1706, which is 6 years after 1700, the answer might be 6 years. However, sometimes in historical contexts, even if the exact date isn't a full year, they might still count the difference in years. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 6 years because the years are 1700 to 1706, which is 6 years apart. For example, if someone died in 1700 and an event happened in 1701, that's 1 year later. So 1700 to 1706 is 6 years.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan Coming off an impressive road performance against the Bengals, the Falcons flew to Ford Field for Week 9 as they took on the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Atlanta would trail early, as Lions kicker Jason Hanson would kick a 28-yard field goal, which would be followed up by a 35-yard TD run by RB Kevin Jones.  The Falcons would score on QB Michael Vick's 19-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler.  In the second quarter, Detroit would get Jones scoring a touchdown on a 2-yard run, while Atlanta had RB Warrick Dunn getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Hanson would get a 19-yard field goal for the Lions with the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Falcons would fall as QB Jon Kitna completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams and Hanson would kick a 36-yard field goal to end the game in favor of Detroit.  With the loss, the Falcons fell to 5-3.Who had the longest touchdown reception of the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking who had the longest touchdown reception in the game between the Falcons and the Lions at Ford Field. The user provided the game summary, so I need to parse through that to find all the touchdown receptions and their lengths.\n\nFirst, let me read through the text again to make sure I don't miss any details. The game is in Week 9, Falcons vs. Lions. The first quarter: Lions kick a 28-yard field goal, then Kevin Jones has a 35-yard TD run. Falcons respond with a 19-yard TD pass from Vick to Crumpler. Second quarter: Lions' Kevin Jones with a 2-yard TD run, Falcons' Warrick Dunn with a 1-yard TD run. Third quarter: Lions kick a 19-yard field goal. Fourth quarter: Lions' Jon Kitna throws a 60-yard TD pass to Roy Williams, then another field goal. Falcons lose, dropping to 5-3.\n\nSo, the question is about the longest touchdown reception. Touchdown receptions are passes caught in the end zone, so I need to look for all instances where a touchdown was scored via a pass. Let's list them out.\n\nFirst quarter: Michael Vick throws a 19-yard TD pass to Alge Crumpler. That's a reception touchdown. Then in the fourth quarter, Jon Kitna throws a 60-yard TD pass to Roy Williams. Are there any others? Let me check again. The other touchdowns mentioned are runs: Kevin Jones had two rushing TDs (35 and 2 yards), and Warrick Dunn had a 1-yard run. The other scores are field goals. So the only two touchdown receptions are Vick to Crumpler (19 yards) and Kitna to Williams (60 yards). Comparing those two, 60 is longer than 19.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web. Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash , Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours. In 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focussing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy to convert Flash animation to HTML5, a tool Google would use to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices.

The question is asking which event happened first: numerous businesses using Flash-based websites to launch new products, or YouTube switching to HTML5 technology.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline provided in the text. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nThe text starts by saying that in the early 2000s, Flash was widely installed on desktops and used for interactive pages, games, and video/audio. Then in 2005, YouTube was founded and used Flash Player for video. Between 2000 and 2010, many businesses used Flash-based websites for products and portals. So the businesses using Flash websites happened between 2000-2010. Then in 2007, YouTube started offering HTML5 for iPhone/iPad. In 2015, Google introduced Swiffy to convert Flash to HTML5, and YouTube switched to HTML5 that same year but kept Flash for older browsers.\n\nSo the key dates here are:\n\n- Businesses using Flash websites: between 2000 and 2010.\n- YouTube switching to HTML5: 2015.\n\nTherefore, the businesses using Flash-based websites happened first, since their time frame starts in 2000 and goes up to 2010, which is well before 2015 when YouTube made the switch to HTML5.\n\nI should double-check to make sure there's no mention of businesses starting after 2005 or something. The text says \"between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites...\" So that's a 10-year span starting in 2000. YouTube's switch to HTML5 was in 2015.

The question is asking how many years the life expectancy increased by. The text says that life expectancy at birth was 46 years in 1978 and later rose to 72. So, I need to find the difference between 72 and 46.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The original life expectancy in 1978 was 46 years. Then it rose to 72. So subtracting 46 from 72 gives 26. That seems straightforward. But let me make sure there's no trick here. The question is phrased as \"how many years did the life expectancy increase by?\" which is just the difference between the two numbers. \n\nThe other information in the text about population growth rates, census data, infant mortality, and school enrollment might be there to distract or provide context, but the key numbers are 46 years in 1978 and 72 years later.

The population density was 221 people per square mile (85/km\u00b2).  There were 102,830 housing units at an average density of 108 per square mile (42/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the county was 87.46% Race (United States Census), 8.31% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.33% Race (United States Census), 0.79% Race (United States Census), 0.04% Race (United States Census), 1.88% from Race (United States Census), and 1.18% from two or more races.  5.61% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race.How many more people are there than households?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more people there are than households in the county as of the 2000 census. Alright, so first, I need to find the number of people and the number of households, then subtract the number of households from the total population to get the difference.\n\nLooking at the text provided: It says there were 210,528 people and 88,413 households. So, the population is 210,528, and households are 88,413. The question is straightforward then, right? Just subtract the number of households from the total population. Wait, but hold on. Wait, households are groups of people living together, so each household has multiple people. But the question is asking how many more people there are than households. So, if there are 210,528 people and 88,413 households, the difference would be 210,528 minus 88,413. Let me check that again. \n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again: \"How many more people are there than households?\" So, it's the total number of people minus the number of households. So, each household is a unit, and the people are individual persons. So, for example, if there are 100 people and 20 households, then there are 80 more people than households. That seems to be the case here. So, yes, 210,528 - 88,413. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me do the subtraction step by step. 210,528 minus 88,413. Let's subtract the thousands first. 210,000 minus 88,000 is 122,000. Then subtract the remaining 413 from 528. 528 minus 413 is 115. So, adding those together, 122,000 + 115 = 122,115. Wait, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 210,528 minus 88,413. Let me write it out:\n\n210,528  \n-\u00a088,413  \n=\u00a0?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digits:  \n8 - 3 = 5  \n2 - 1 = 1  \n5 - 4 = 1  \n0 (since we borrow here) - 8. Wait, hold on. Let me do it properly.\n\nWait, maybe I should align the numbers:\n\n210,528  \n-088,413  \n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 (units place) - 3 = 5  \n2 (tens place) - 1 = 1  \n5 (hundreds place) - 4 = 1  \n0 (thousands place) - 8. Wait, here we have 0 in the thousands place of the minuend (210,528) and 8 in the subtrahend (88,413). But since 0 is less than 8, we need to borrow from the ten-thousands place. \n\nThe ten-thousands place in 210,528 is 1 (since it's 210,528: 2 hundred thousands, 1 ten thousands, 0 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 8 units). Wait, actually, let's break it down:\n\n210,528 is 2*100,000 + 1*10,000 + 0*1,000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 8*1  \n88,413 is 8*10,000 + 8*1,000 + 4*100 + 1*10 + 3*1\n\nSo when subtracting:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n8 (units) - 3 = 5  \n2 (tens) - 1 = 1  \n5 (hundreds) - 4 = 1  \n0 (thousands) - 8. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the ten-thousands place. The ten-thousands place is 1, so borrowing 1 makes it 0, and the thousands place becomes 10. But we need to subtract 8 from that 10 (after borrowing), so 10 - 8 = 2. \n\nNow, the ten-thousands place was originally 1, but we borrowed 1, so it's now 0. Then, the hundred-thousands place is 2. So, the next digit (ten-thousands place) is 0 - 8 (from the subtrahend). Wait, the subtrahend's ten-thousands place is 8 (from 88,413). Wait, no. Wait, the subtrahend is 88,413, which is 8 ten-thousands, 8 thousands, 4 hundreds, 1 ten, 3 units. Wait, but when we write it out aligned:\n\n      210,\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to rebound from a tough loss to the Patriots, the Bills would play their Week 2 home opener in an interconference duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This would be the first time that Buffalo ever hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, having played a preseason game with each other in 1977. In the first quarter, the Bills came out firing as quarterback Trent Edwards completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans, safety Donte Whitner returning an interception 76 yards for a touchdown and kicker Rian Lindell making a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers would get on the board in the second quarter as quarterback Byron Leftwich completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, while Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 43-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would close out the half as Leftwich completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. After a scoreless third quarter, the Bills began to pull away as Lindell got a 43-yard field goal and Edwards completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Buccaneers tried to rally as Leftwich completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens (with a failed two-point conversion), yet Buffalo closed out the game with Lindell nailing a 20-yard field goal. With the win, the Bills improved to 1-1.In which quarter were no points scored?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking in which quarter no points were scored during the Bills vs. Buccaneers game described.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the text and note down the points scored in each quarter. Let me read the text again carefully.\n\nThe game starts with the first quarter. The Bills scored a 32-yard touchdown pass (which is 7 points), then a 76-yard interception return for a touchdown (another 7 points), and a 31-yard field goal (3 points). So in the first quarter, the Bills scored 7 + 7 + 3 = 17 points. Wait, but touchdowns are 6 points each, plus extra points. Wait, the text says \"touchdown pass\" and \"returning an interception for a touchdown\". So each of those would be 6 points plus the extra point, making 7 each. Then the field goal is 3. So total first quarter points: 7 + 7 + 3 = 17. But the Buccaneers didn't score in the first quarter.\n\nThen in the second quarter, the Buccaneers scored a 42-yard TD pass (7 points), then the Bills replied with a 43-yard FG (3 points). Then the Buccaneers scored an 8-yard TD pass (7 points). So second quarter points: 7 (Bucs) + 3 (Bills) + 7 (Bucs) = 17 points total. So both teams scored in the second quarter.\n\nThird quarter: The text says \"After a scoreless third quarter...\" Wait, that's directly mentioned. So the third quarter had no points. Then in the fourth quarter, the Bills scored a 43-yard FG (3 points), a 43-yard TD pass (7 points). Then the Buccaneers scored a 6-yard TD pass (6 points, but they failed the two-point conversion, so only 6 instead of 7 or 8). Then the Bills closed with a 20-yard FG (3 points). So fourth quarter points: 3 +7 +6 +3 = 19 points. But the key point is that the third quarter was scoreless.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The game was a rematch of the divisional playoff game of the previous season in which the Broncos beat the Patriots and ended their record 10-game playoff winning streak.  The Broncos won 17-7, improving their record to 2-1.  The Broncos scored a 23-yard field goal (by kicker Jason Elam) and a touchdown in the second quarter (a 32-yard TD pass from QB Jake Plummer to Javon Walker). Plummer and Walker would hook up for another touchdown in the fourth quarter with an 83-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos held New England to only 50 yards on the ground, while Tatum Bell ran for 123 yards. The Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when Tom Brady threw an 8-yard pass to Doug Gabriel. The Broncos became the first team since the 1942 Chicago Cardinals to begin their season with 11 straight quarters without allowing their opponents to score a touchdown.How many more touchdown passes did Jake Plummer make over Tom Brady?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more touchdown passes Jake Plummer made over Tom Brady in that Broncos vs. Patriots game on September 24. Alright, so I need to figure out how many touchdown passes each quarterback threw during the game and then subtract Brady's total from Plummer's to get the difference.\n\nFirst, let me go through the text again to pick out the relevant information. The Broncos won 17-7. In the second quarter, Jake Plummer threw a 32-yard TD pass to Javon Walker. Then in the fourth quarter, they connected again for an 83-yard touchdown pass. So that's two touchdown passes for Plummer. \n\nOn the Patriots' side, Tom Brady threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Doug Gabriel in the fourth quarter. That's one touchdown pass for Brady. \n\nWait, let me check again. The Broncos scored a field goal and two touchdowns. The touchdowns were both passes from Plummer to Walker. The Patriots only scored one touchdown, which was Brady's pass to Gabriel. So Plummer has 2 TD passes, Brady has 1.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Due to the rib injury to quarterback Donovan McNabb, backup quarterback Kevin Kolb was named the starter. In the first quarter, Philadelphia trailed as Saints quarterback Drew Brees completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston.  The Eagles would answer with Kolb completing a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson, but New Orleans replied with kicker John Carney making a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal.  However, the Saints struck back as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 25-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans began to pull away as Brees completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans, along with running back Mike Bell getting a 7-yard touchdown.  Philadelphia would answer with Kolb completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jason Avant.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued to pull away as running back Reggie Bush got a 19-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would get a score as Brees fumbled the ball out of his own end zone, giving Philadelphia a safety.  However, the Saints closed out their victory march as safety Darren Sharper returned an interception 97 yards for a touchdown.How many field goals over 23 yards were made before the third quarter?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many field goals over 23 yards were made before the third quarter in this Eagles vs. Saints game.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the text step by step and note all the field goals mentioned, paying attention to the quarter they were in and their distances. The question specifically asks for field goals over 23 yards made before the third quarter, so that would be in the first and second quarters only.\n\nLooking at the first quarter: The Saints' kicker John Carney made a 23-yard field goal. Wait, the question is about field goals over 23 yards. So exactly 23 yards doesn't count because it's not over. So that one is 23, which is not over, so it's excluded.\n\nIn the second quarter: The Eagles' kicker David Akers made a 23-yard field goal to tie the game. Again, that's exactly 23, so not over. Then later in the second quarter, Akers made a 32-yard field goal. Wait, let me check. Wait, the text says: \"In the second quarter, Philadelphia would tie the game again as kicker David Akers got a 23-yard field goal. However, the Saints struck back... The Eagles would close out the half as Akers made a 32-yard field goal.\" Wait, so in the second quarter, there are two field goals by Akers: first a 23-yard, then a 32-yard. The 32-yard is over 23, so that counts. So that's one.\n\nThen in the third quarter, the Saints start pulling away, but the question is about before the third quarter, so third quarter and beyond are not considered. So any field goals in the third or fourth quarters don't count here.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nFirst quarter: Saints' Carney 23-yard (not over, so no)\nSecond quarter: Eagles' Akers 23-yard (no), then Akers 32-yard (yes)\nThird quarter: No field goals mentioned here. The Saints scored touchdowns. The Eagles also scored a touchdown. So no field goals in the third quarter.\n\nFourth quarter: The Eagles got a safety, and Saints had a pick-6. No field goals in the fourth.\n\nSo the only field goal over 23 yards before the third quarter is Akers' 32-yard in the second quarter.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Then the Bears responded with kicker Robbie Gould making a 34 and a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Bears fell further behind when QB Jay Cutler was sacked in the endzone by free safety Jordan Babineaux for a safety.

After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility.How many points did Dirk Nowitzki average in the series?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many points Dirk Nowitzki averaged in the 2011 NBA Finals series. Alright, I need to find his total points across all the games in the series and then divide by the number of games to get the average.\n\nFirst, let me recall the information given in the text. The Mavericks played against the Heat in the Finals. The series went to six games because they mention game 6 where the Mavericks won the title. The text states that Nowitzki averaged 26 points per game during the series. Wait, actually, the last sentence says, \"Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series...\" So that seems like the answer is right there. But maybe I should verify to make sure there's no trick here.\n\nBut let me check the rest of the text to confirm. The user might be testing if I can extract the correct information even if there are other numbers mentioned. For example, in game 6, Nowitzki scored 21 points, and Terry had 27. But the average is given explicitly as 26. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nThe series had six games. If he averaged 26 points per game, then total points would be 26 * 6 = 156. Let's check if the individual game points add up. The text mentions in game 2, he was part of the comeback but doesn't specify his points. Game 3, he missed the potential game-tying shot, but again, no points. Game 4, he hit big shots. Game 5, they mention Jason Kidd and Terry hitting shots, but Nowitzki's points aren't specified. Game 6, he scored 21 points, with 18 in the second half. So if his average is 26, then over six games, that's 156 total. But in game 6 he had 21. Let's see if that's possible. If he had 21 in game 6, then the other five games would need to sum to 135. So 135 divided by 5 is 27. So maybe he had higher points in other games. But the text doesn't give his points for each game, except game 6. However, the text explicitly states he averaged 26 points per game. So unless there's a contradiction, the answer is 26. The question is straightforward, and the answer is given directly in the text. So I think the answer is 26.\n</think>\n\nThe text explicitly states that Dirk Nowitzki averaged 26 points per game during the 2011 NBA Finals series.

            "question": "Given the question statement:During the 15th century the Ayutthaya Kingdom fought frequent wars against the Lan Na Kingdom in the north, the Khmer Empire of Angkor Wat to the east and the Malay States to the south. King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh. The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441. Thao Lok was crowned as king Tilokaraj of Lan na, later banishing his father Sam Fang Kaen to Muong Shan in the Shan States. General Phya Samdekyoki, who had previously played an important role in bringing Tilokaraj to power created a plot in order to assume power himself, the plot was however discovered and Samdekyoki was exiled to Chiang Saen.How many sons did Sam Fang Kaen have before Thao Lok?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many sons Sam Fang Kaen had before Thao Lok. The question is asking specifically about the number of sons he had before Thao Lok, so I need to look through the text provided to find any mentions of his children.\n\nLooking at the text: \"The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of a coup against his father in 1441.\" So Thao Lok is referred to as the sixth son. That suggests that Sam Fang Kaen had at least six sons, with Thao Lok being the sixth. Therefore, before Thao Lok, there would have been five older sons. But wait, the question is how many sons did he have before Thao Lok. If Thao Lok is the sixth, then he had five sons before him. But maybe the count includes Thao Lok himself? Wait, no. If Thao Lok is the sixth son, that means there were five sons born before him, making him the sixth. So the total number of sons would be at least six. But the question is asking how many sons Sam Fang Kaen had before Thao Lok. So the answer would be five, right? Because Thao Lok is the sixth, so there are five older brothers. But the text doesn't mention any other sons besides Thao Lok. Wait, but the text only mentions Thao Lok as the sixth son. So even if the others aren't named, the ordinal number \"sixth\" implies that there were five prior sons. Therefore, the answer should be six sons in total, but before Thao Lok, there were five. Wait, but the question is asking how many sons he had before Thao Lok. So if Thao Lok is the sixth, then he had five sons before him. But maybe the answer is six, considering that Thao Lok is included? Wait, no. The wording is \"how many sons did Sam Fang Kaen have before Thao Lok?\" So before Thao Lok came into existence, how many sons did he have? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"before Thao Lok\" meaning prior to Thao Lok's ascension, but the key is that Thao Lok is the sixth son. So regardless of when they were born, the fact that he's the sixth son means there were five older sons.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

With Vince Young recovering from a quad injury, back-up QB Kerry Collins was given the start. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 52-yard field goal. The Texans would respond with LB DeMeco Ryans returning a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Titans answered with Bironas kicking a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Tennessee began to pound away as Bironas got a 21-yard field goal, while RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Bironas would end the half with a 30-yard and a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Titans continued its domination with Bironas kicking a 43-yard field goal, while rookie RB Chris Henry got a 4-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. Afterwards, Tennessee managed to reply. With Bironas' 29-yard field goal, he became the 5th kicker in NFL history to get 7 field goals in one game. However, the Texans managed to retake the lead with Rosenfels completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jeb Putzier and a 53-yard TD pass to WR Andr&#233; Davis. Fortunately, the Titans managed to get a historic last-second field goal. With his 29-yard field goal, not only did it seal the win for Tennessee, but it made Rob Bironas the first kicker in NFL history to get 8 field goals in one game.Which player had the longest TD pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which player had the longest TD pass in this game between the Titans and the Texans. The question is asking for the longest touchdown pass, so I need to look through the text and find all the instances where a touchdown pass was thrown, note the length of each, and then determine which one was the longest.\n\nFirst, let me read through the text again to make sure I don't miss any details. The game summary mentions several scoring plays. Let's break it down quarter by quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Titans scored with a field goal. The Texans responded with a fumble return for a TD by DeMeco Ryans. That's a defensive touchdown, not a pass, so that doesn't count here. Then the Titans added another field goal.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Titans scored a field goal and a 1-yard TD run by LenDale White. Again, a rushing TD, not a pass. Then two more field goals by Bironas.\n\nThird quarter: another Titans field goal and a 4-yard TD run by Chris Henry. Still a rushing play.\n\nFourth quarter is where the Texans start rallying. Sage Rosenfels throws a 7-yard TD pass to David Anderson, then a 6-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter. Later, after the Titans get another field goal (making Bironas's 7th), the Texans retake the lead with Rosenfels throwing a 7-yard TD to Jeb Putzier and a 53-yard TD pass to Andr\u00e9 Davis. Finally, the Titans win with Bironas's 8th field goal.\n\nSo, the TD passes mentioned are all by Sage Rosenfels of the Texans. Let's list them out:\n\n1. 7-yard TD pass to David Anderson\n2. 6-yard TD pass to Kevin Walter\n3. 7-yard TD pass to Jeb Putzier\n4. 53-yard TD pass to Andr\u00e9 Davis\n\nLooking at these, the longest one is the 53-yard pass to Andr\u00e9 Davis. That's definitely the longest touchdown pass in the game. The others are all 7 yards or shorter. So the player who threw the longest TD pass is Sage Rosenfels, and the longest was 53 yards. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which player had the longest TD pass. Since all the TD passes were thrown by Sage Rosenfels, he's the one. But let me double-check if there were any other quarterbacks mentioned throwing TD passes. The Titans' starting QB was Kerry Collins, but the text doesn't mention him throwing any TD passes. The Titans scored via field goals and rushing TDs. The only passing TDs are from Rosenfels. So yes, Sage Rosenfels is the answer, and his longest was 53 yards. That's the longest TD pass in the game.\n</think>\n\nThe longest TD pass in the game was a 53-yard pass thrown by Sage Rosenfels to Andr\u00e9 Davis. Rosenfels threw four touchdown passes in total, with the 53-yarder being the longest.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:After a tough loss on Monday Night Football, the Bengals returned home for Week 2 against the Browns.  The Bengals were able to get the first points on the board with Adam \"Pacman\" Jones returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown for a 7-0 lead.  The Browns then shortened their lead to 4 points with Phil Dawson's 50-yard field goal to make the score 7-3.  The Bengals then moved ahead by 11 points as Andy Dalton found A. J. Green on a 10-yard touchdown pass for a 14-3 lead, however the Browns again came within 4 as Trent Richardson ran for a touchdown from 32 yards out.  The Bengals then moved ahead 17-10 with Mike Nugent's 39-yard field goal before halftime.  Coming back, the Bengals increased their lead with Dalton finding Brandon Tate on a 44-yard pass for a 24-10 lead.  However, The Browns drew closer as Brandon Weeden found Richardson on a 23-yard pass to shorten the game to 24-17.  Then the Bengals moved up in the 4th quarter as Dalton found Andrew Hawkins on a 50-yard touchdown pass for a 31-17 lead but the Browns came within a touchdown after Weeden found Greg Little on a 24-yard pass to make the score 31-24.  Mike Nugent then nailed a 37-yard field goal to give the Bengals a 34-24 lead then the Browns wrapped things up as Phil Dawson scored a 25-yard field goal for a final score of 34-27.How many total field goal yards were made before halftime by anyone?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many total field goal yards were made before halftime by anyone in the Bengals vs. Browns game described. Alright, so I need to go through the text and pick out all the field goals that happened before halftime, then add up their yardages.\n\nFirst, let me read through the text again to make sure I don't miss any details. The game starts with the Bengals getting a touchdown on a punt return by Adam Jones for 7-0. Then the Browns get a 50-yard field goal by Phil Dawson, making it 7-3. Then the Bengals score another TD, 14-3. Browns respond with a TD run, 14-10. Then the Bengals kick a 39-yard field goal by Mike Nugent to make it 17-10 before halftime. After halftime, there are more scores, but the question specifically asks for field goals before halftime. So I need to check which field goals were before halftime.\n\nLooking at the timeline: The first field goal is Phil Dawson's 50-yarder for the Browns, bringing the score to 7-3. Then later, before halftime, the Bengals' Mike Nugent makes a 39-yard field goal to make it 17-10. The next field goal mentioned is in the 4th quarter by Mike Nugent again (37 yards) and then Phil Dawson with a 25-yarder at the end. But those are after halftime. So before halftime, there are two field goals: 50 yards by Browns and 39 yards by Bengals. \n\nSo total field goal yards before halftime would be 50 + 39 = 89 yards. Let me double-check the text to make sure there aren't any other field goals mentioned before halftime. The text says \"before halftime\" when talking about the 39-yarder. The other field goals are after halftime. So yes, only those two.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:Trying to snap a five-game losing skid, the Panthers stayed at home for a Week 13 intraconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with kicker John Kasay nailing a 19-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Panthers increased their lead with QB Vinny Testaverde completing a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Dante Rosario, while CB Richard Marshall returned an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the 49ers managed to get on the board as QB Trent Dilfer completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle and a 1-yard TD pass to TE Delanie Walker. Afterwards, Carolina went back to work as RB DeShaun Foster got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers pulled away as Testaverde completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King. With the win, not only did Carolina improve to 5-7, but it even managed to give the Panthers their first home win of the year.How many 1 yard TDs were there?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many 1-yard touchdowns there were in the game described. I need to go through the text carefully and count each instance where a touchdown was scored from 1 yard out.\n\nStarting with the first quarter: the Panthers scored a 19-yard field goal. That's not a touchdown, so no count there.\n\nSecond quarter: Panthers increased their lead with a 5-yard TD pass from Testaverde to Rosario. That's a 5-yard touchdown, so not 1 yard. Then Marshall returned an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. That's a defensive touchdown, but the distance here is 67 yards, so again, not a 1-yard TD.\n\nThird quarter: 49ers get on the board. Dilfer throws a 20-yard TD pass to Battle. That's 20 yards, so no. Then Dilfer throws a 1-yard TD pass to Walker. Okay, that's one 1-yard TD. So that's the first one.\n\nAfterwards, Panthers' DeShaun Foster gets a 1-yard TD run. That's the second 1-yard TD.\n\nFourth quarter: Testaverde completes a 1-yard TD pass to Jeff King. That's the third 1-yard TD.\n\nSo adding those up: 1 (Dilfer to Walker) + 1 (Foster run) + 1 (Testaverde to King) = 3 total 1-yard touchdowns.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's go through again:\n\n- 1st quarter: FG, no TD.\n- 2nd quarter: 5-yard TD pass and 67-yard interception return. No 1-yarders.\n- 3rd quarter: 20-yard TD (Battle), 1-yard TD (Walker), then Foster 1-yard run. So two in the third.\n- 4th quarter: 1-yard TD pass (King).

            "question": "Given the question statement:In 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying $40,000 for his flight. NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200-300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttles cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.How many fewer dollars would people pay in 15 years to travel to space over the initial cost per person at the smallest estimate?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the question is asking: \"How many fewer dollars would people pay in 15 years to travel to space over the initial cost per person at the smallest estimate?\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find two numbers: the initial cost per person and the cost after 15 years. Then, subtract the latter from the former to find the difference, which is the \"fewer dollars\" people would pay in 15 years. The answer should be the initial cost minus the future cost, right?\n\nLooking at the text provided. Let me scan through it again to find the relevant numbers. The key parts here are about the costs mentioned. The initial cost is probably the one without government subsidy, and the future cost after 15 years is the projected amount people would pay.\n\nThe text says: \"A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft.\"\n\nSo, here's the breakdown. The initial cost per person is between $1 million and $1.5 million. But the question specifies \"the smallest estimate.\" The smallest estimate of the initial cost would be $1 million, since that's the lower end of the range given ($1 to 1.5 million). \n\nThen, in 15 years, the projection is that people would pay $25,000 each. So, the cost after 15 years is $25,000 per person.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the initial cost (smallest estimate) and the 15-year cost is $1,000,000 - $25,000. Let me calculate that.\n\n1,000,000 minus 25,000 is 975,000. So, people would pay $975,000 fewer dollars in 15 years compared to the initial smallest estimate.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. The initial cost is $1 million to $1.5 million without subsidy. The 15-year projection is $25,000. The question is asking how many fewer dollars they would pay in 15 years over the initial cost at the smallest estimate. So yes, the smallest initial is $1 million, subtract the $25k, which gives $975,000. That seems right.\n\nI don't see any other numbers mentioned for the 15-year cost. The other figures like 30,000 people a year and the lunar missions in 30 and 50 years are probably just context. The key numbers are $1-1.5 million initial and $25k after 15 years.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The Texans took control throughout the game as QB Matt Schaub got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen, followed by his 2-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The lead was increased when kicker Neil Rackers hit a 35 and a 33-yard field goal. With the easy win, the Texans improved to 5-6.  However, Johnson was ejected following a fight with Titans CB Cortland Finnegan, who was also ejected.How many wins did the Texans have after the game?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many wins the Texans had after the game described. Let me read through the text again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe text starts by listing the starting lineups for Houston, which probably isn't directly relevant to the number of wins, but maybe useful context. Then it says they were hoping to snap a four-game losing streak. So before this game, they had lost four in a row. The game was a home game against the Titans, an AFC South rival. \n\nThe Texans took control throughout the game. Schaub threw two touchdown passes, one to Dreessen and one to Andre Johnson. Then the kicker made two field goals, 35 and 33 yards. They ended up with an easy win, improving their record to 5-6. Then there's a note about Johnson and Finnegan being ejected after a fight, but that probably doesn't affect the win count.\n\nSo the key sentence here is: \"With the easy win, the Texans improved to 5-6.\" That means after this game, their win-loss record is 5 wins and 6 losses.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 96.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.50 males.Which age group is smaller: 25 to 44 or 45 to 64?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which age group is smaller between 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 in the county's population. The given percentages are 31.60% for 25-44 and 23.70% for 45-64. Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm reading that right.\n\nThe age distribution is broken down as follows:\n- Under 18: 27.90%\n- 18 to 24: 6.80%\n- 25 to 44: 31.60%\n- 45 to 64: 23.70%\n- 65 or older: 10.10%\n\nSo, the two groups in question are 25-44 at 31.6% and 45-64 at 23.7%. Comparing these two percentages directly, 23.7% is less than 31.6%. Therefore, the 45 to 64 age group is smaller. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there's any trick here. The problem mentions the median age is 36 years. The median age being 36 means that half the population is younger than 36 and half is older. Since 36 falls within the 25-44 age group, that might indicate that the 25-44 group is larger because the median is within that range. But the percentages already show that 25-44 is 31.6% and 45-64 is 23.7%, so even with the median in 25-44, the numbers still support that 45-64 is smaller. \n\nAlso, the gender ratios are given, but I don't think they affect the total percentages of each age group. The question is about the size of the age groups, not the gender distribution within them. So those numbers about males per 100 females might be a red herring here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the 45-64 age group has a smaller percentage (23.7%) compared to 25-44 (31.6%).\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:In Ancient Egypt the Bronze Age begins in the Protodynastic period, c.\u20093150 BC. The archaic early Bronze Age of Egypt, known as the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt, immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, c.\u20093100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Abydos to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. Memphis in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.The Old Kingdom of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement - the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley . The First Intermediate Period of Egypt, often described as a \"dark period\" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt and Thebes in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in the reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.Which began first in Egypt, the Bronze Age or the Old Kingdom?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which began first in Egypt: the Bronze Age or the Old Kingdom.

Then it mentions the Early Dynastic Period, which follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt around 3100 BC. The Early Dynastic Period includes the First and Second Dynasties and lasts until about 2686 BC, which is when the Old Kingdom begins. \n\nWait, the Old Kingdom is part of the Bronze Age, right? Because the Bronze Age in Egypt starts in the Protodynastic period (3150 BC), and the Old Kingdom comes later in the 3rd millennium BC. The Old Kingdom is described as the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, so it's a phase within the broader Bronze Age. \n\nSo the Bronze Age began first, during the Protodynastic period (3150 BC), and the Old Kingdom started later, around 2686 BC.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The Bills responded and tied the game with Ryan Fitzpatrick throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Steve Johnson. At overtime the decision was made with Succop successfully hitting a 35-yard field goal with 5 seconds left on the clock to win the game for the Chiefs.How many total yards did Ryan Succop kick for field goals?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Hoover appointed a commission to study the situation, with William Cameron Forbes as the chair.:232-233 The Forbes Commission praised the material improvements that the U.S. administration had achieved, but it criticized the continued exclusion of Haitian nationals from positions of real authority in the government and the constabulary, which had come to be known as the Garde d'Ha\u00efti. In more general terms, the commission asserted that \"the social forces that created  still remain - poverty, ignorance, and the lack of a tradition or desire for orderly free government.\" The Hoover administration did not fully implement the recommendations of the Forbes Commission; but United States withdrawal was under way by 1932, when Hoover lost the presidency to Franklin D.

Their estates were confiscated and their families relocated \u2014 Zrinski's wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in the Dominican convent in Graz where she fell mentally ill and remained until her death in 1673, two of his daughters died in a monastery, and his son Ivan Antun  died in madness, after twenty years of terrible imprisonment and torture, on 11 November 1703. The oldest daughter Jelena, already married in northeastern Upper Hungary, survived and continued the resistance. Some 2,000 other nobles were arrested as part of a mass crackdown.  Two more leading conspirators \u2014 Ferenc N\u00e1dasdy, Chief Justice of Hungary, and Styrian governor, Count Hans Erasmus von Tattenbach \u2014 were executed . In the view of Emperor Leopold, the Croats and Hungarians had forfeited their right to self-administration through their role in the attempted rebellion. Leopold suspended the constitution - already, the Zrinski trial had been conducted by an Austrian, not a Hungarian court - and ruled Hungary like a conquered province.How many daughters did Zrinski have?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many daughters Zrinski had. The text mentions that Zrinski's wife, Katarina Zrinska, was interned in a convent, and two of his daughters died in a monastery. Then it says the oldest daughter Jelena survived. So, if two died and there's an oldest one who survived, that makes three daughters total. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nThe text says: \"two of his daughters died in a monastery, and his son Ivan Antun died...\" Then \"The oldest daughter Jelena... survived.\" So, two daughters died, and the oldest daughter Jelena is separate. That would mean three daughters. Because \"two of his daughters\" implies there are at least two, but then there's another one, the oldest. Unless \"two of his daughters\" includes Jelena? Wait, no. Because Jelena is specified as the oldest and she survived. The two that died are separate. So total three daughters. Let me confirm. The text says \"two of his daughters died in a monastery\" and \"the oldest daughter Jelena... survived.\" So that's three daughters in total. Unless there's a possibility that Jelena is one of the two, but the wording says \"two of his daughters died\" and then mentions Jelena as the oldest who survived. So three daughters. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to a 45-yard field goal by Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. An interception off Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian by cornerback Logan Ryan resulted in the only touchdown of the game&#8212;a 1-yard run by Patriots' running back LeGarrette Blount in the second quarter. Gostkowski added two more field goals&#8212;a 40-yarder in the third quarter and a 21-yarder in the fourth. The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for this game.How many yards longer was Stephen Gostkowski's longest field goal compared to Brandon McManus' field goal?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many yards longer Stephen Gostkowski's longest field goal was compared to Brandon McManus' field goal. Alright, so first I need to find out the lengths of both their longest field goals in the game described.\n\nLooking at the text, it says the Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by Brandon McManus. So McManus's field goal was 33 yards. Got that.\n\nNow for Stephen Gostkowski, the Patriots' placekicker. The text mentions a few of his field goals. Let me parse through the details. In the first quarter, there's a 45-yard field goal by Gostkowski. Then in the third quarter, he adds a 40-yarder, and in the fourth quarter, a 21-yarder. So his field goals were 45, 40, and 21 yards. The longest of those is 45 yards.\n\nSo Gostkowski's longest is 45, McManus's is 33. The question is asking how many yards longer Gostkowski's longest was compared to McManus's. So subtract McManus's from Gostkowski's: 45 - 33 = 12.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The events began with a coup by the Persian Cossack Brigade headed by Reza Khan, and directed by the British, on 21 February 1921. With this coup Zia'eddin Tabatabaee took over power and became Prime Minister. The coup was largely bloodless and faced little resistance. With his expanded forces and the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan launched successful military actions to eliminate separatist and dissident movements in Tabriz, Mashhad and the Janglis in Gilan. The campaign against Simko and the Kurds was less successful and lasted well into 1922, though eventually concluding with Persian success.When did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking when Zia'eddin Tabatabaee became a servant. Wait, that seems a bit odd. The original text mentions that after the 1921 coup led by Reza Khan, Zia'eddin Tabatabaee took over as Prime Minister. The term \"servant\" here might be a mistranslation or a misunderstanding. In political contexts, sometimes \"servant\" is used in titles like \"public servant,\" but in this case, the text clearly states he became the Prime Minister.\n\nLooking at the question again: \"When did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant?\" The answer should be when he took power as Prime Minister, which was on 21 February 1921, the date of the coup. The text says the coup happened on that date, and with it, Tabatabaee became Prime Minister. The term \"servant\" might be confusing, but given the context, it's referring to his assumption of the Prime Minister position. There's no mention of him becoming a servant in any other capacity.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

On 24 April, the Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle.The government forces ambushed Zhu Di, and the Yan forces suffered a series of defeat initially. Landmines were placed in the retreat path of the Yan forces by the government forces, which inflicted heavy losses for the Yan Army on their way back to the camp.A new battle ensued the following day, and the government forces were successful in attacking the rear of the Yan forces. Zhu Di led a personal charge against the main force of Li Jinglong, and the battle turned into a stalemate as Zhu Gaochi arrived with reinforcements.At this point, the wind started to blow and snapped the flag of Li Jinglong in half, which led to chaos in the government camp. Zhu Di seized the opportunity and launched a general assault and defeated the government forces. More than 100,000 government troops surrendered to the Yan forces, and Li Jinglong retreated back to Dezhou once again. On 27 April, the Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou to siege the city. The Yan forces captured Dezhou on 9 May, and Li Jinglong was forced to flee to Jinan. The Yan forces followed up immediately and encircled the city of Jinan on 15 May, and Li Jinglong fled back to Nanjing. Despite of losing the entire army and being condemned by the imperial court, Li Jinglong was spared of execution.How many days after the Yan forces engaged with the government forces in a decisive battle did the Yan forces capture Dezhou?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many days after the decisive battle the Yan forces captured Dezhou. The question is asking for the number of days between the initial engagement and the capture of Dezhou.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the dates mentioned in the text. The decisive battle started on April 24th. Then, after some events, the Yan forces began marching toward Dezhou on April 27th. They captured Dezhou on May 9th. So I need to calculate the number of days from April 24th to May 9th.\n\nWait, but let me check the timeline again. The battle started on April 24th. Then on the following day, which would be April 25th, there was another battle. Then the wind incident happened, leading to the defeat of the government forces. After that, the Yan forces started marching toward Dezhou on April 27th. They captured Dezhou on May 9th. So the time from April 24th to May 9th is the period we need to calculate.\n\nBut wait, the question is how many days after the decisive battle (which was on April 24th) did the Yan forces capture Dezhou (on May 9th). So from April 24th to May 9th. Let's count the days.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 24th to April 30th is 6 days (since 30 - 24 = 6, but including the 24th? Wait, no. If the battle was on the 24th, then the next day is the 25th. So from April 24th to April 24th is 0 days, then each subsequent day adds one. So from April 24th to April 30th is 6 days (25th to 30th is 6 days). Then from May 1st to May 9th is 9 days. So total days would be 6 + 9 = 15 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. If the battle was on April 24th, then the next day is April 25th (1 day after), April 26th (2 days), April 27th (3 days), ..., April 30th is 6 days after April 24th (since 30 -24 =6, but including the starting day? Hmm, no. If you start counting from the day after, maybe. Let's think differently.\n\nThe number of days between two dates is calculated by subtracting the start date from the end date. But since it's inclusive or exclusive? The question is \"how many days after the engagement did the capture happen\". So if the engagement is on day 0 (April 24), then the days after would start counting from the next day.\n\nSo April 24: day 0\n\nApril 25: day 1\n\nApril 26: day 2\n\nApril 27: day 3\n\n...\n\nMay 9: let's count.\n\nFrom April 24 to April 30: 30 -24 =6 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 6 days, but since we start counting after the 24th, the days after would be 6 days (25th to 30th) plus 9 days in May (1st to 9th).

Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapests boundaries during work hours, and during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events. By ethnicity there were 1,397,851 (80.8%) Hungarians, 19,530 (1.1%) Romani people, 18,278 (1.0%) Germans, 6,189 (0.4%) Romanians, 4,692 (0.3%) Han Chinese and 2,581 (0.1%) Slovaks. 301,943 people (17.5%) did not declare their ethnicity. In Hungary people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population. The city is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.How many  more percent were Hungarians than Romanians at the 2011 census?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many more percent were Hungarians than Romanians at the 2011 census in Budapest. Hmm. Alright, first, I need to find the percentage difference between the Hungarian population and the Romanian population. \n\nFrom the text, the data given is: Hungarians were 1,397,851, which is 80.8% of the population. Romanians were 6,189, which is 0.4% of the population. Wait, but the question is about how many more percent Hungarians there are compared to Romanians. So, maybe I need to calculate the percentage difference between these two groups. \n\nBut wait, the percentages are already given. So, if Hungarians are 80.8% and Romanians are 0.4%, then the difference in percentage points is 80.8% - 0.4% = 80.4%. But the question says \"how many more percent,\" which might be asking for the relative percentage increase, not the absolute difference. Hmm, that's a common point of confusion. Let me think.\n\nIf we want to know how much higher the percentage of Hungarians is compared to Romanians in relative terms, we need to calculate (Hungarian% - Romanian%) / Romanian% * 100. That would give the percentage by which Hungarians are more than Romanians. Alternatively, if they just want the absolute difference in percentage points, it's 80.4%. But the question says \"how many more percent,\" which usually implies a relative comparison. Let me check the exact wording: \"How many more percent were Hungarians than Romanians...\" So, yes, that's a relative percentage difference. \n\nSo, using the formula: ((Hungarians - Romanians)/Romanians) * 100. But wait, the percentages are already given. So, if Hungarians are 80.8% and Romanians are 0.4%, then the calculation would be (80.8 - 0.4)/0.4 * 100 = (80.4)/0.4 * 100 = 201 * 100 = 20,100%. Wait, that seems extremely high. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the difference in percentage points, which is 80.8% - 0.4% = 80.4 percentage points. But the question says \"how many more percent,\" which is ambiguous. However, in common usage, when someone asks \"how many more percent is X than Y,\" they usually mean (X - Y)/Y * 100%. So, in this case, (80.8 - 0.4)/0.4 * 100 = 80.4 / 0.4 * 100 = 201 * 100 = 20,100%. That seems way too high, but mathematically, if you take the percentage points and express the difference relative to the Romanian percentage, that's the result. \n\nBut maybe the question is actually referring to the actual numbers, not the percentages. Let me check the data again. The total population is 1,729,040. Hungarians: 1,397,851. Romanians: 6,189. So, the actual numbers. So, if we calculate the percentage of Hungarians relative to the total population, which is given as 80.8%, and Romanians as 0.4%. But maybe the question is asking, using the counts, how much more in percentage terms are Hungarians than Romanians. So, using the counts: (1,397,851 - 6,189)/6,189 * 100. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, subtract: 1,397,851 - 6,189 = 1,391,662. Then divide by 6,189: 1,391,662 / 6,189 \u2248 224.8. Multiply by 100: 22,480%. That's even higher. But that's the percentage increase from Romanian to Hungarian population. But that seems absurd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the difference in percentage points, which is 80.8% - 0.4% = 80.4 percentage points. But the way the question is phrased, \"how many more percent,\" might be expecting a relative percentage. However, given that the percentages are already provided, maybe the answer is 80.4 percentage points. But the problem is that in the text, it's mentioned that people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population. Wait, but the percentages given are of the total population.

The two major opposition parties  lost their previous eight seats, thus resulting in an opposition-free Parliament. The Central Election Commission said turnout was 50.1%, out of a total 4.9 million people eligible to vote.

Wait, but the text also mentions that the other seats went to independent candidates and soft opposition parties. The two major opposition parties lost their previous eight seats, leading to an opposition-free parliament.

The Ravens immediately responded as WR Yamon Figurs returned a kickoff 94&#160;yards for a touchdown, yet Indianapolis continued its run with Manning completing a 57-yard TD pass to rookie WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, the Colts put the game away with Manning finding Gonzalez again on a 40-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried a feeble comeback as QB Kyle Boller completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling, while QB Troy Smith got a 6-yard TD run.

The question is asking about the specific quarter where he scored the most TDs in the game described.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the game summary and pick out all the instances where Joseph Addai scored a touchdown. Let me read through the text again carefully.\n\nIn the first quarter, it says: \"Indianapolis got onto the scoreboard first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 34-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, while RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run.\" So here, Addai has a 1-yard TD run in the first quarter. Then, \"Afterwards, Manning and Addai hooked up with each other on a 19-yard TD pass...\" Wait, that's interesting. So Manning threw a 19-yard TD pass to Addai. So that's a receiving touchdown for Addai. So in the first quarter, Addai has two touchdowns: one rushing and one receiving.\n\nThen in the second quarter: \"Addai made an 11-yard TD run.\" So that's another rushing TD, making it his third TD overall. Then the rest of the game summary mentions other players scoring, like Anthony Gonzalez in the second and third quarters, and the Ravens' players in the fourth.

Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 20.1 percent to $2.8 billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion, while net rough diamond imports dropped 12.9 percent to $3.8 billion. Net exports and imports have dropped due to the ongoing Global financial crisis, particularly within the European sovereign-debt crisis and the United States.

The question is asking which year had a higher amount in net polished diamond exports, 2012 or 2011. The text provided gives some numbers about Israel's diamond exports.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant data points. The text mentions that in 2012, Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent. It says polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011. Wait, so 2011 had $7.2 billion and 2012 had $5.56 billion. That seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers.\n\nThe text also states that net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion. Hmm, that might be a different figure. Wait, maybe there's a distinction between \"polished diamond exports\" and \"net exports of polished diamonds\"? Let me check again.\n\nThe first part says: \"Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.\" So here, they're saying that in 2011, the polished diamond exports were $7.2 billion, and in 2012, they fell by 22.8% to $5.56 billion. That would mean 2011 is higher.\n\nBut then later, it says: \"net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. So there's a mention of two different numbers for 2012: $5.56 billion and $4.3 billion. That's confusing. Maybe I need to parse the sentences more carefully.\n\nLet me break down the text step by step. The first sentence says Israel is a major center for diamond cutting. Then: \"Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.\" So here, \"net polished diamond exports\" in 2012 are $5.56 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2011. So 2011 is higher.\n\nThen the next sentence: \"Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 20.1 percent to $2.8 billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion, while net rough diamond imports dropped 12.9 percent to $3.8 billion.\" Wait, now they're talking about \"net exports of polished diamonds\" slipping 24.9% to $4.3 billion. But earlier, they said polished diamond exports (net) were $5.56 billion in 2012. So which is it?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a difference between \"net polished diamond exports\" and \"net exports of polished diamonds\"? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the text. Let me check again.\n\nFirst paragraph: \"Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.\" So here, \"net polished diamond exports\" in 2012 are $5.56B, down 22.8% from 2011's $7.2B. Then in the next sentence, \"net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion.\" Wait, that's a different percentage and a different number. How can that be?\n\nPerhaps the first figure ($5.56B) is the total polished diamond exports, and the second figure ($4.3B) is the net exports (exports minus imports)? Let me think. The term \"net exports\" usually means exports minus imports. So maybe the first mention is gross exports, and the second is net exports. But the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, the first sentence says \"net polished diamond exports slid 22.8 percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.\" So here, \"net polished diamond exports\" and \"polished diamond exports\" are used interchangeably? Maybe the author is using \"net\" here to mean the total after some adjustments, but perhaps in the next sentence, they break down the components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo or misstatement in the text. Let me try to parse all the numbers given:\n\n- 2012 net polished diamond exports: $5.56B (down 22.8% from 2011's $7.2B)\n- Net exports of rough diamonds in 2012: $2.8B (down 20.1%)\n- Net exports of\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:In week 15, the Lions traveled west for an interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders struck first when Louis Murphy ran in a touchdown from 12 yards out. The Lions responded with a 51-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson. In the second quarter, Oakland re-took the lead when Darrius Heyward-Bey caught a 43-yard pass from Carson Palmer, but the Lions tied it back up when Nate Burlseon caught a 39-yard pass for a TD. Oakland took the lead back just before halftime with a 46-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After a scoreless third quarter, the Raiders kicked a 51-yard field goal, and added 7 more points when Aaron Curry picked up a Matthew Stafford fumble and ran it in 6 yards for a touchdown, putting them up 27-14 with just under 8 minutes left in the game. The Lions then mounted their 6th comeback of the season from a 13+ point deficit, first with a 3-yard catch by Titus Young, then Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 6 yards out to put them up 28-27 with 39 seconds left to play. The Raiders then drove down the field, and attempted a 65-yard field goal on fourth down, which would have broken Sebastian Janikowski's own NFL-record of 63 yards which he shares with two other placekickers, but it was blocked by Ndamukong Suh, giving the Lions the win and keeping their playoff hopes alive as the team improved to 9-5, securing their first winning season since 2000.How many catches did Titus Young have?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many catches Titus Young had in this game. The question is about a specific NFL game between the Lions and the Raiders in week 15. The user provided a detailed text describing the game's events, and we need to extract the number of catches Titus Young made.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully to find any mentions of Titus Young. The key part here is the fourth quarter where the Lions are making their comeback. The text says: \"The Lions then mounted their 6th comeback of the season from a 13+ point deficit, first with a 3-yard catch by Titus Young, then Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 6 yards out to put them up 28-27 with 39 seconds left to play.\"\n\nSo, in that part, Titus Young is mentioned making a 3-yard catch for a touchdown. Now, the question is asking for the number of catches he had. The text only mentions one specific catch by him during the comeback. There's no other mention of Titus Young elsewhere in the game summary provided. \n\nI need to check if there are any other instances where his name appears. Let me scan through the text again. The first quarter mentions Calvin Johnson with a 51-yard TD, second quarter has Nate Burleson with a 39-yard TD. Then in the fourth quarter, after the Raiders scored, the Lions' comeback starts with Titus Young's 3-yard TD catch. Then Calvin Johnson again for the second TD. The rest of the plays involve other players like Stafford, Palmer, Heyward-Bey, Janikowski, and Aaron Curry. \n\nSince the text doesn't mention Titus Young having any other receptions besides that one touchdown catch, it's safe to assume that he had only 1 catch in the game. However, sometimes in football, a player might have multiple catches, but only one is mentioned because it's a touchdown. But in this case, the text is a summary, not a full play-by-play.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The Siamese army invaded Chiang Mai, catching the Burmese command completely off guard. The Siamese captured Chiang Mai on 10 February 1663, and drove back Burmese forces that arrived belatedly at Sai Yok. In November 1663, the Siamese then led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then laid siege to Pagan in 1664. Burmese defences withstood several Siamese onslaughts until May 1664 before the rainy season arrived, after \"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\", the Siamese retreated.:220-239 Meanwhile, the Siamese garrison at Chiang Mai was holed up in a deserted city, and its troops were constantly ambushed by resistance forces whenever they ventured out of the city. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai, and returned.What did the Siamese capture last: Pegu or Chiang Mai?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking whether the Siamese captured Pegu or Chiang Mai last based on the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully and note the timeline of events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe text starts by mentioning a second expedition to bring Lan Na under control again. The Siamese army invades Chiang Mai and captures it on 10 February 1663. Then they drive back Burmese forces at Sai Yok. In November 1663, the Siamese invade Burma with 60,000 troops, capturing several cities: Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu. After that, they lay siege to Pagan in 1664. The siege lasts until May 1664 when the rainy season arrives, causing the Siamese to retreat after many casualties and capturing prisoners. \n\nMeanwhile, the Siamese garrison in Chiang Mai is having trouble. The city is deserted, and their troops are ambushed when they go out. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuate Chiang Mai and return.\n\nThe question is asking which city was captured last: Pegu or Chiang Mai. \n\nLooking at the timeline: Chiang Mai was captured first on 10 February 1663. Then, during the invasion of Burma starting in November 1663, they capture Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu. The order of these captures isn't specified beyond the list, but they are listed in sequence. So Pegu is captured after the other cities in that list. Then they lay siege to Pagan in 1664. The siege ends in May 1664 when they retreat. \n\nHowever, the Siamese were still in Chiang Mai until late November 1664 when they evacuated. Wait, but they captured Chiang Mai in February 1663, then later in November 1664 they evacuated it. So the capture of Chiang Mai was in 1663, and the evacuation was in 1664. But the question is about what they captured last. The cities captured during the invasion of Burma (Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu) happened after the initial capture of Chiang Mai. So the last capture would be Pegu, as part of the Burma invasion in 1663-1664. Then after that, they laid siege to Pagan but didn't capture it. Then later in November 1664, they evacuated Chiang Mai, but that's not a capture\u2014it's leaving a city they had captured earlier. \n\nSo the last capture would be Pegu, which was part of the Burma campaign. The evacuation of Chiang Mai is them leaving a city they had already captured earlier.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Pegu was captured last.  Chiang Mai was initially captured much earlier, in February 1663.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chiefs the Seahawks played on home ground for an NFC duel with the Panthers. In the first quarter the Seahawks trailed early as RB Mike Goodson got a 6-yard TD run, followed by RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 3-yard TD run. They commanded the rest of the game with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 24-yard field goal, followed by RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run, then with Lofa Tatupu returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. The lead was extended with Lynch getting a 1 and a 22-yard TD run. With the win, not only did the Seahawks improve to 6-6, they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.how many points did the seahawks improve by?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many points the Seahawks improved by in this game. The question is a bit tricky because it's asking about their improvement, not just the total points they scored. Wait, the last sentence says, \"With the win, not only did the Seahawks improve to 6-6, they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.\" Hmm, so maybe the question is actually asking by how many wins they improved compared to the previous two seasons? Because \"points\" in sports usually refer to the score in a game, but here the context is about their season record. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe user wrote: \"how many points did the seahawks improve by?\" But in the text provided, the Seahawks went to 6-6, surpassing their victory mark of the last two seasons. So maybe \"points\" here is a mistranslation or misunderstanding, and they actually mean \"how many wins\" did they improve by compared to the last two seasons. Because \"points\" in a game would be the score difference, but the answer here is about their season record.\n\nWait, let's check the original text again. The Seahawks improved to 6-6 and surpassed their victory mark of the last two seasons. So their previous two seasons' victory marks must have been less than 6 wins. Let's assume that in the previous two seasons combined, their total wins were less than 6, but that seems unlikely. Wait, no, each season has a certain number of games. Wait, in the NFL, each team plays 16 games in a regular season. So if they're talking about the last two seasons, maybe each season they had a certain number of wins, and now they've surpassed the total of those two? Or maybe each of the last two seasons they had a certain number, and now in this season they have 6 wins, which is more than either of the last two seasons. Let me parse the exact wording: \"they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.\" So \"victory mark\" probably refers to the number of wins in a single season. So if in each of the last two seasons, their highest number of wins was, say, 5, then getting to 6 this season would be an improvement by 1 win. But the question is asking \"how many points did they improve by?\" which is confusing because points usually refer to game scores. Maybe the user made a mistake and meant \"how many wins\" or \"how many games\". Alternatively, maybe the question is about the point differential in this particular game, but the answer is in the context of their season record. Wait, the game described here is a single game where they won, moving their record to 6-6. The problem is asking \"how many points did the Seahawks improve by?\" which could be ambiguous. Let me check the game's scoring. Let's calculate the total points the Seahawks scored in this game versus the Panthers. The Panthers scored two touchdowns in the first quarter: a 6-yard TD run by Mike Goodson and a 3-yard TD run by Jonathan Stewart. Each TD is 6 points, so Panthers had 2 TDs, so 12 points. Then the Seahawks scored: Olindo Mare made a 24-yard FG (3 points), Marshawn Lynch with a 1-yard TD run (7 points including the extra point), Lofa Tatupu with a 26-yard interception return for a TD (7 points), then Lynch again with two more TDs: 1-yard and 22-yard runs (each worth 7 points). So let's add up the Seahawks' points: 3 (FG) + 7 (Lynch TD1) + 7 (Tatupu INT TD) + 7 (Lynch TD2) + 7 (Lynch TD3) = 3 +7+7+7+7= 31 points. The Panthers only scored 12 points (2 TDs, no extra points mentioned? Wait, in the NFL, a TD is 6 points, and the extra point is 1, so each TD is 7 points unless they missed the extra point. But the text doesn't mention extra points, so maybe we have to assume they made them. Wait, but the problem statement might be simplified. Let me check again. The Panthers' TDs: \"RB Mike Goodson got a 6-yard TD run, followed by RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 3-yard TD run.\" So that's two TDs, each worth 6 points, but in reality, they would kick an extra point, making each 7. But the problem might be considering only the TD points without the extra points. Similarly, the Seahawks' TDs: Lynch's 1-yard TD\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The racial makeup of the city was 69.7% White (down from 94.8% in 1970), 5.0% Black or African-American, 2.7% Native American, 2.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 16.9% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 41.6% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 47.2% of the population in 2010, down from 72.8% in 1970.How many percent were not from 2 or more races?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking: \"How many percent were not from 2 or more races?\" based on the provided census data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data given. The racial makeup percentages add up to 100%, right? Let me check the numbers:\n\n- White: 69.7%\n- Black or African-American: 5.0%\n- Native American: 2.7%\n- Asian: 2.9%\n- Pacific Islander: 0.2%\n- Other races: 16.9%\n- Two or more races: 3.8%\n\nAdding those up: 69.7 + 5.0 + 2.7 + 2.9 + 0.2 + 16.9 + 3.8. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\n69.7 + 5.0 = 74.7\n\n74.7 + 2.7 = 77.4\n\n77.4 + 2.9 = 80.3\n\n80.3 + 0.2 = 80.5\n\n80.5 + 16.9 = 97.4\n\n97.4 + 3.8 = 101.2\n\nWait, that's 101.2%. Hmm, that's a bit over 100%. Maybe there's a rounding error in the percentages? Because each category is rounded to the nearest tenth, so when you add them up, the total might slightly exceed 100% due to rounding. That's a common thing in such data. So, the total is approximately 100%, considering the rounding.\n\nBut the question is about the percentage not from two or more races. The data says that 3.8% are from two or more races. So, to find the percentage not from two or more races, we subtract that from 100%.\n\nSo, 100% - 3.8% = 96.2%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The question is phrased as \"not from 2 or more races.\" So, all the other categories (White, Black, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Other) are single-race categories. The two or more races is a separate category. Therefore, the percentage not from two or more races would be 100% minus 3.8%, which is 96.2%.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Let's add up all the single-race categories:\n\n69.7 + 5.0 + 2.7 + 2.9 + 0.2 + 16.9 = ?\n\n69.7 + 5.0 = 74.7\n\n74.7 + 2.7 = 77.4\n\n77.4 + 2.9 = 80.3\n\n80.3 + 0.2 = 80.5\n\n80.5 + 16.9 = 97.4\n\nSo, 97.4% are from single races, and 3.8% are from two or more races. But 97.4 + 3.8 = 101.2%, which again shows the rounding issue. But since the question is about the percentage not from two or more races, it's 100% - 3.8% = 96.2%. However, if we take the sum of the single-race categories as 97.4%, that would contradict. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the \"other races\" category is 16.9%, and \"two or more races\" is 3.8%. So, the total is 97.4% + 3.8% = 101.2%.

The Cowboys, in an attempt to not repeat the mistakes of the previous week, sent Dan Bailey out to kick a field goal to trail 17-20 early in the 4th. The Redskins extended their lead to 23-17 after another field goal. At the 3:29 mark, the Cowboys went back to work to start at their own 13 yard line. Romo led the Cowboys downfield thanks in large part to a Terrance Williams 51 yard catch and then a Dez Bryant catch and run for 17 yards to set up first and goal at the Redskins' 4 yard line. DeMarco Murray carried the ball for all three plays (+3, no gain, -9). Facing 4th and goal at the Washington 10 yard line,  Tony Romo climbed the pocket and fired a pass to DeMarco Murray in the end zone to tie the game 23-23.
