If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:The sentence \"the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump\" is negative.

Looking at the sentiment:\n   - Cold porridge has negative connotations\n   - The word \"only\" minimizes the positive aspect (chewy lump)\n   - Overall tone is disappointing and negative\n\n3. According to the question rules:\n   - 1 for positive sentiment\n   - 0 for negative sentiment\n\n4. Based on the provided thought process:\n   - The sentence is described as negative\n   - Cold porridge is noted as \"unappetizing\"\n   - Even the \"enjoyably chewy lump\" is not enough to make it positive\n   - It's characterized as an \"unpleasant texture and taste\"\n\n5.

The question asks for:\n   - 1 if positive\n   - 0 if negative\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- While \"sad\" starts negative, \"but endearing\" shifts the overall tone to positive\n- The \"but\" construction emphasizes \"endearing\" over \"sad\"\n- The final sentiment leans positive despite containing a negative element\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\boxed{1}\n\nThe answer is 1 because while the phrase contains both positive and negative elements, the structure and emphasis on \"endearing\" makes the overall sentiment positive.",
