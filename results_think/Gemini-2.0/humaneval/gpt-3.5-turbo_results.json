We are given a grid representing wells, where each '1' represents a unit of water. We have buckets of a certain capacity, and we want to find the minimum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty all the wells.  Essentially, for each row (well), we need to determine how many buckets are needed to remove all the water in that well, and then sum up the number of buckets needed for all wells.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Iterate through each row (well) in the grid.**\n2.  **For each row, count the number of '1's, which represents the total water in that well.**\n3.  **Divide the total water by the bucket capacity. If the result is not an integer, round up to the nearest integer.** This gives the number of buckets needed for that well.\n4.  **Sum the number of buckets needed for each well to get the final answer.**\n\n```python\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells.

We want to determine if $n$ can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Let $n = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d$, where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers.\nThen $n = 2(a+b+c+d)$. This means that $n$ must be an even number.\nLet $n = 2k$, where $k$ is an integer. Then $2k = 2(a+b+c+d)$, so $k = a+b+c+d$.\nSince $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers, the minimum value of $a+b+c+d$ is $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\nThus, $k \\ge 4$.\nSince $n = 2k$, we have $n \\ge 2(4) = 8$.\nTherefore, $n$ must be an even number greater than or equal to 8.\n\nIf $n$ is even and $n \\ge 8$, then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Since $n \\ge 8$, $2k \\ge 8$, so $k \\ge 4$.\nWe want to find positive integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a+b+c+d = k$.\nSince $k \\ge 4$, we can always find such positive integers. For example, we can set $a=1, b=1, c=1, d=k-3$. Since $k \\ge 4$, $k-3 \\ge 1$, so $d$ is a positive integer.\nThus, if $n$ is even and $n \\ge 8$, then $n$ can be written as the sum of 4 positive even integers.\n\nTherefore, the function should return True if $n$ is even and $n \\ge 8$, and False otherwise.\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    return n % 2 == 0 and n >= 8\n```\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The code initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of sentences starting with 'I'.\n2. It splits the input string based on '.', '?', and '!' to extract individual sentences.\n3.

This is important because trailing spaces would make the last character a space, which is not an alphabet.\n3.  Check if the string is empty after removing trailing spaces: If the string is empty after removing trailing spaces, return `False`.\n4.  Get the last character: Get the last character of the string.\n5.  Check if the last character is an alphabet: Check if the last character is an alphabet using `isalpha()`. If not, return `False`.\n6.  Check if the last character is part of a word: If the last character is an alphabet, it should not be part of a word. This means there should be a space before it or it should be the first character of the string. Since we have already removed trailing spaces, we only need to check if the character before it is a space.\n\n```python\ndef check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):\n    '''\n    Create a function that returns True if the last character\n    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not\n    a part of a word, and False otherwise.\n    Note: \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space.\n\n    Examples:\n    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\") \u279e False\n    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e\") \u279e True\n    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e \") \u279e False\n    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"\") \u279e False \n    '''\n    txt = txt.rstrip()\n    if not txt:\n        return False\n    last_char = txt[-1]\n    if not last_char.isalpha():\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\n```python\ndef check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):\n    txt = txt.rstrip()\n    if not txt:\n        return False\n    last_char = txt[-1]\n    if not last_char.isalpha():\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Nested means that there's at least one bracket pair enclosed within another bracket pair.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Check for valid subsequences:** We can use a stack to check if there's a valid subsequence of brackets.

The function `solve(N)` takes a positive integer `N` as input. The goal is to calculate the sum of the digits of `N`, and then convert this sum into its binary representation (as a string).\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of digits:** Iterate through the digits of the integer `N`.  We can achieve this by repeatedly taking the modulo 10 of `N` to get the last digit, adding it to a running sum, and then integer dividing `N` by 10 to remove the last digit. This continues until `N` becomes 0.\n\n2.  **Convert the sum to binary:** After calculating the sum, convert it to its binary representation.  We can do this by repeatedly taking the modulo 2 of the sum to get the last bit, prepending it to a string, and then integer dividing the sum by 2. This continues until the sum becomes 0. If the sum is initially 0, the binary representation is \"0\".\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve(N):\n    \"\"\"Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.\n    \n    Example\n        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be \"1\".\n        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be \"110\".\n        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be \"1100\".\n    \n    Variables:\n        @N integer\n             Constraints: 0 \u2264 N \u2264 10000.\n    Output:\n         a string of binary number\n    \"\"\"\n    sum_of_digits = 0\n    temp = N\n    while temp > 0:\n        sum_of_digits += temp % 10\n        temp //= 10\n    \n    if sum_of_digits == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    binary_representation = \"\"\n    while sum_of_digits > 0:\n        binary_representation = str(sum_of_digits % 2) + binary_representation\n        sum_of_digits //= 2\n    \n    return binary_representation\n```\n\n```python\nsolve(147)\n```\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

We are given an array `arr` and an integer `k`. We need to return a sorted list of the `k` largest elements in `arr`.\n\nA straightforward approach would be to sort the array and then take the last `k` elements. However, we need to return a sorted list of those `k` elements, so we can simply sort the entire array and return the last `k` elements.\n\nAnother approach would be to use a min-heap of size `k`. We iterate through the array. If the current element is greater than the smallest element in the heap, we replace the smallest element with the current element and heapify. After iterating through the array, the heap will contain the `k` largest elements. We can then sort the heap and return it.\n\nA third approach would be to use the `nlargest` function from the `heapq` module. This function returns a list with the n largest elements from a dataset.

We are given an array and we can perform right shift operations on it. We need to check if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing these operations.\n\nThe core idea is to try all possible right shift operations and check if any of them result in a sorted array. Since the array has `N` elements, we can perform at most `N` right shift operations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  Handle the empty array case: If the array is empty, return `True`.\n2.  Iterate through all possible right shift operations (from 0 to N-1 shifts).\n3.  For each shift, create a new array that is the result of the right shift.\n4.  Check if the new array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n5.  If a sorted array is found, return `True`.\n6.  If none of the shifts result in a sorted array, return `False`.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    \"\"\"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered.

The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, and the remaining $n-2$ digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.\nSo, $|B| = 9 \\times 10^{n-2}$.\n\nWe want to find $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$.\n$A \\cap B$ is the set of $n$-digit integers that start and end with 1.\nThe first digit is 1, the last digit is 1, and the remaining $n-2$ digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.\nSo, $|A \\cap B| = 10^{n-2}$.\n\nTherefore, $|A \\cup B| = 10^{n-1} + 9 \\times 10^{n-2} - 10^{n-2} = 10^{n-1} + 8 \\times 10^{n-2} = 10 \\times 10^{n-2} + 8 \\times 10^{n-2} = 18 \\times 10^{n-2}$.\n\nFor example, if $n=1$, the $n$-digit integers are 1 to 9.

Since we don't have any bounds, we can start with a large interval, say [-100, 100], and iteratively narrow down the interval until we find a root or the interval becomes sufficiently small.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n\ndef poly(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\n    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])\n\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    \"\"\" xs are coefficients of a polynomial.\n    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.\n    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.\n    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients\n    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees\n    a solution.\n    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x\n    -0.5\n    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    low = -100.0\n    high = 100.0\n    while high - low > 1e-6:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2.0\n        if poly(xs, low) * poly(xs, mid) > 0:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2.0\n```\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n\ndef poly(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\n    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])\n\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    \"\"\" xs are coefficients of a polynomial.\n    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.\n    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.\n    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients\n    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees\n    a solution.\n    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x\n    -0.5\n    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    low = -100.0\n    high = 100.0\n    while high - low > 1e-6:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2.0\n        if poly(xs, low) * poly(xs, mid) > 0:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2.0\n```\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

We are given two strings, `a` and `b`. We need to check if `b` or any of its rotations is a substring of `a`.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rotations of `b`. If `b` has length `n`, then there are `n` rotations of `b`. We can generate these rotations by shifting the characters of `b` to the left (or right) by one position at a time.\n\nFor example, if `b` is \"abc\", then the rotations are \"abc\", \"bca\", and \"cab\".\n\nOnce we have the rotations of `b`, we can check if any of these rotations is a substring of `a`.
