He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour.

There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, the Chiefs were attempting to re-claim the lead midway through the fourth quarter, when Smith was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. However, the Broncos went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. The Chiefs took a 24-17 lead six plays later, with running back Knile Davis rushing for an 8-yard touchdown with 2:27 left in the game. Manning then engineered a 10-play, 80-yard drive, culminating in a 19-yard touchdown pass to Sanders with 36 seconds left. The game appeared to be headed to overtime, however, on the initial play of the Chiefs' ensuing possession, Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall forced a fumble off Charles deep in Chiefs' territory, and cornerback Bradley Roby returned the fumble 21 yards for a touchdown with 27 seconds in the game.

It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers.How many years after the April Uprising was the Berlin Treaty signed?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:The April Uprising broke out in 1876.

This would be a rematch of last year's AFC Divisional game. The Ravens drew first blood when Joe Flacco found Vonta Leach on a 2-yard touchdown pass to take the lead 7-0 in the first quarter for the only score of the period.  The Broncos would tie the game in the 2nd quarter with Peyton Manning finding Julius Thomas on a 24-yard pass to take the game to 7-7.  The Ravens moved back into the lead when Ray Rice ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make the score 14-7.  Peyton would find Julius again on a 23-yard pass to make the score 14-14 for another tie before the Ravens kicker Justin Tucker nailed a 25-yard field goal to make the score 17-14 at halftime.  In the 3rd quarter, the Broncos went right back to work as Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-17 lead followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28-17 and then to 35-17.

The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey.  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game. With this win the Broncos remained tied with the Chargers in the AFC West with a 6-2 record.How many yards difference was Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s touchdown pass compared to Jake Plummer 's first touchdown pass?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass was 15 yards.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Looking to secure their third straight win and another division title, the Patriots returned home to face the 7-7 Jaguars. After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks.  During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops.

Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \"Captain General.\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle.

Therefore, the youth unemployment rate in the EU was 18% in 2011 and 12.5% in 2007. Thus, the unemployment rate was higher in 2011, not 2012. However, the question asks whether the unemployment rate was higher in 2012 or 2007. The text only provides the unemployment rate for 2007 (12.5%) and 2011 (18%). We don't have the EU unemployment rate for 2012. However, the question is about the youth unemployment rate in the EU.

We don't know the rate in 2012.\nThe text says the youth unemployment rate \"rose to 18% last year from 12.5% in 2007\". Since the article is from 2012, \"last year\" is 2011.

The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0.

The archaic early Bronze Age of Egypt, known as the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt, immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, c.\u20093100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Abydos to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. Memphis in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.The Old Kingdom of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement - the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley . The First Intermediate Period of Egypt, often described as a \"dark period\" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt and Thebes in Upper Egypt.

            "question": "Given the question statement:A second expedition had to be conducted to bring Lan Na under control again. The Siamese army invaded Chiang Mai, catching the Burmese command completely off guard. The Siamese captured Chiang Mai on 10 February 1663, and drove back Burmese forces that arrived belatedly at Sai Yok. In November 1663, the Siamese then led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Moulmein, Syriam, Rangoon, Pegu, and then laid siege to Pagan in 1664. Burmese defences withstood several Siamese onslaughts until May 1664 before the rainy season arrived, after \"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\", the Siamese retreated.:220-239 Meanwhile, the Siamese garrison at Chiang Mai was holed up in a deserted city, and its troops were constantly ambushed by resistance forces whenever they ventured out of the city. In late November 1664, the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai, and returned.What did the Siamese capture last: Pegu or Chiang Mai?\n\nUse following thought to solve it:The text states that the Siamese captured Pegu before laying siege to Pagan. It also states that the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai in late November 1664. The siege of Pagan occurred until May 1664, before the Siamese retreated. Since the Siamese evacuated Chiang Mai in late November 1664, which is after they captured Pegu, the Siamese captured Chiang Mai last. However, the question asks what the Siamese captured last between Pegu and Chiang Mai. The Siamese captured Pegu in 1663 and evacuated Chiang Mai in late November 1664. Therefore, the Siamese captured Pegu before evacuating Chiang Mai. The question is asking what they captured last, so we need to determine if they captured Pegu or Chiang Mai last. The Siamese captured Pegu during their invasion of Burma in November 1663. They evacuated Chiang Mai in late November 1664. Since the capture of Pegu happened before the evacuation of Chiang Mai, the Siamese captured Pegu last.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

In the third quarter, Kirk Cousins threw two touchdown passes to give the Redskins a 20-14 lead at the end of the 3rd. The Cowboys, in an attempt to not repeat the mistakes of the previous week, sent Dan Bailey out to kick a field goal to trail 17-20 early in the 4th. The Redskins extended their lead to 23-17 after another field goal. At the 3:29 mark, the Cowboys went back to work to start at their own 13 yard line. Romo led the Cowboys downfield thanks in large part to a Terrance Williams 51 yard catch and then a Dez Bryant catch and run for 17 yards to set up first and goal at the Redskins' 4 yard line. DeMarco Murray carried the ball for all three plays (+3, no gain, -9). Facing 4th and goal at the Washington 10 yard line,  Tony Romo climbed the pocket and fired a pass to DeMarco Murray in the end zone to tie the game 23-23. With the extra point good, the Cowboys led 24-23 with 1:01 remaining in the game. Washington started their drive on their own 13 yard line after a 10-yard illegal block penalty negated what would have been a 21-yard return (to the WAS 23). Kirk Cousins and co. could not sustain their drive, totaling 4 yards on four passing attempts. The Redskins turned the ball over on downs with 40 seconds remaining in the game. Lining up in the victory formation, Tony Romo was able to kneel the ball down and run the clock out. With the win, the Cowboys advanced to 5-0 in the NFC East and kept their playoff hopes alive to set up a do-or-die at home versus the Eagles. Romo was seen limping through most of the fourth quarter after rolling out of what would have been a sack by Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson. The Cowboys later confirmed injury reports of Romo suffering a herniated disc in his lower back. Despite statements that he will be ready to face Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles for the NFC East Championship, Romo was placed on Injured Reserve.
