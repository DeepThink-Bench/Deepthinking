            "output": "To determine the most reasonable scenario outcome, we need to evaluate the options based on their alignment with the goal of preventing students from cheating. The goal is to ensure that test materials are secure and inaccessible to students before the test.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Option 1:**  \n   \"Some students may try to access test questions before a test, even if that means they have to break into your classroom or office to get them. [substeps] To prevent this, never leave your keys hanging in the door and don't give them to a trusted student for any reason.\"  \n   - This option directly addresses the issue of securing test materials by emphasizing the importance of not leaving keys accessible or trusting students with them. It provides a clear preventive measure to avoid unauthorized access, which aligns with the goal of preventing cheating.\n\n2. **Option 2:**  \n   \"Make sure that you don't lock your class door or give a password to anyone who enters your classroom. [substeps] Exam-deadlines are an important reason to prohibit classroom access.\"  \n   - This option contradicts the goal of securing test materials. Not locking the classroom door or giving passwords to anyone would make it easier for students to access test materials, which increases the risk of cheating. This is not a reasonable outcome.\n\n3. **Option 3:**  \n   \"This way, students may find it hard to duplicate material from the test. [substeps] If you want to make sure that students, you should try to keep the material in a separate folder that is easily accessible to all students.\"  \n   - This option suggests making test materials accessible to all students, which directly undermines the goal of preventing cheating. Allowing students to access test materials before the test would make it easier for them to cheat. This is not a reasonable outcome.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most reasonable scenario outcome is **Option 1**, as it provides a practical and effective measure to secure test materials and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{answer = 1}\n\\]",
