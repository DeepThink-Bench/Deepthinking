Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_value_in_record(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the maximum value as negative infinity\n    max_value = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        # Extract the record list from the tuple\n        record_list = tup[1]  # Assuming the record list is the second element of the tuple\n        \n        # Find the maximum value in the record list\n        current_max = max(record_list)\n        \n        # Update the overall maximum value if the current maximum is greater\n        if current_max > max_value:\n            max_value = current_max\n    \n    return max_value\n\n# Example usage:\ntuple_list = [(\"A\", [1, 2, 3]), (\"B\", [4, 5, 6]), (\"C\", [7, 8, 9])]\nresult = find_max_value_in_record(tuple_list)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 9\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_value` to negative infinity to ensure any value in the record lists will be larger.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each tuple in the `tuple_list`.\n3. **Extraction**: For each tuple, we extract the record list (assuming it's the second element of the tuple).\n4. **Finding Maximum**: We use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the current record list.\n5. **Updating Maximum**: We compare the current maximum value with the overall `max_value` and update `max_value` if the current maximum is greater.\n6. **Return**: Finally, we return the `max_value`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\ndef remove_duplicate_words(s):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Use OrderedDict to remove duplicates while preserving order\n    unique_words = OrderedDict.fromkeys(words)\n    # Join the unique words back into a string\n    return ' '.join(unique_words)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"hello world hello world this is a test\"\nresult = remove_duplicate_words(input_string)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"hello world this is a test\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into a list of words using the `split()` method.\n2. **Removing Duplicates**: `OrderedDict.fromkeys(words)` creates an `OrderedDict` where each word is a key. Since dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, this effectively removes duplicates while preserving the order of the first occurrence of each word.\n3. **Joining the Words**: The unique words are then joined back into a single string using `' '.join(unique_words)`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\n\\boxed{\\text{from collections import OrderedDict}\\\\\n\\text{def remove\\_duplicate\\_words(s):}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{words = s.split()}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{unique\\_words = OrderedDict.fromkeys(words)}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{return ' '.join(unique\\_words)}}\n```\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

We expand the window by moving `right` and shrink it by moving `left` when the condition `arr[right] - arr[left] > k` is violated.\n3. **Max Window Size**: We keep track of the maximum window size where the condition is satisfied.\n4. **Result**: The minimum number of elements to remove is the total number of elements minus the size of the largest valid window.\n\nFor the example `arr = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]` and `k = 5`, the largest valid window is `[1, 3, 6]` with a size of 3.

Inside the function:\n   - We use `filter()` with a lambda function\n   - The lambda function `lambda x: x % m == 0 or x % n == 0` checks if:\n     - `x % m == 0` (number is divisible by m) OR\n     - `x % n == 0` (number is divisible by n)\n   - `filter()` returns only the elements that satisfy this condition\n   - We convert the filter object to a list using `list()`\n\n3. For the given example:\n   - Input: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n   - `m = 2` and `n = 3`\n   - The output will be `[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]` because:\n     - Numbers divisible by 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n     - Numbers divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9\n     - Combined unique numbers: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10\n\n4. The result is then formatted using the required `\\boxed{}` notation.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\n\\boxed{[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]}\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently combines functional programming concepts (lambda and filter) with basic arithmetic operations to solve the problem.",

The function `is_concatenation` takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It iterates over possible lengths of the substring (from 1 to half the length of `s`).\n3.

Sum the counts of unset bits for all numbers.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef count_unset_bits(n):\n    total_unset = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        binary = bin(i)[2:]  # Convert to binary string without '0b' prefix\n        total_unset += binary.count('0')\n    return total_unset\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nanswer = count_unset_bits(n)\nprint(f\"Total unset bits from 1 to {n}: \\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` to a binary string and removes the `'0b'` prefix.\n- The `count('0')` method counts the number of `'0'` characters in the binary string.\n- The loop iterates through all numbers from `1` to `n`, and the total count of unset bits is accumulated in `total_unset`.\n\n### Example:\nFor `n = 10`, the binary representations and unset bits are:\n- `1`: `1` \u2192 0 unset bits\n- `2`: `10` \u2192 1 unset bit\n- `3`: `11` \u2192 0 unset bits\n- `4`: `100` \u2192 2 unset bits\n- `5`: `101` \u2192 1 unset bit\n- `6`: `110` \u2192 1 unset bit\n- `7`: `111` \u2192 0 unset bits\n- `8`: `1000` \u2192 3 unset bits\n- `9`: `1001` \u2192 2 unset bits\n- `10`: `1010` \u2192 2 unset bits\n\nTotal unset bits: `0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12`\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

For n = 10, let's see each number's binary representation and count of unset bits:\n   ```\n   1  -> 1     (0 unset bits)\n   2  -> 10    (1 unset bit)\n   3  -> 11    (0 unset bits)\n   4  -> 100   (2 unset bits)\n   5  -> 101   (1 unset bit)\n   6  -> 110   (1 unset bit)\n   7  -> 111   (0 unset bits)\n   8  -> 1000  (3 unset bits)\n   9  -> 1001  (2 unset bits)\n   10 -> 1010  (2 unset bits)\n   ```\n\n2. Adding all unset bits:\n   0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12\n\nTherefore, for n = 10, \\boxed{12} is the answer.\n\nThe solution has a time complexity of O(n * log n) since for each number from 1 to n, we need to convert it to binary and count zeros. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store the running total.\n\nYou can test the function with different values of n by modifying the input in the main() function.",

In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.\n2. **Extract elements from the heap**: Repeatedly remove the largest element from the heap (which is the root of the heap) and place it at the end of the array. After each extraction, restore the heap property.\n3. **Repeat until the heap is empty**: Continue the process until all elements are extracted and the array is sorted.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the heap sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef heapify(arr, n, i):\n    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root\n    left = 2 * i + 1  # left child\n    right = 2 * i + 2  # right child\n\n    # If left child exists and is greater than root\n    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = left\n\n    # If right child exists and is greater than largest so far\n    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = right\n\n    # If largest is not root\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)  # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree\n\ndef heap_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Build a max-heap\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    # Extract elements one by one\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # Swap\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]\nheap_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **heapify function**: This function ensures that the subtree rooted at index `i` is a max-heap.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Write a function to convert a roman numeral to an integer.\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, we can use a dictionary to map Roman numeral characters to their corresponding integer values. We then iterate through the Roman numeral string, summing the values while handling subtractive combinations (e.g., \"IV\" for 4, \"IX\" for 9).\n\nHere\u2019s the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    roman_to_int_map = {\n        'I': 1,\n        'V': 5,\n        'X': 10,\n        'L': 50,\n        'C': 100,\n        'D': 500,\n        'M': 1000\n    }\n    total = 0\n    prev_value = 0\n    for char in reversed(s):\n        current_value = roman_to_int_map[char]\n        if current_value < prev_value:\n            total -= current_value\n        else:\n            total += current_value\n        prev_value = current_value\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = roman_to_int(\"MCMXCIV\")\nprint(result)  # Output: 1994\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We use a dictionary `roman_to_int_map` to map each Roman numeral character to its integer value.\n2. We initialize `total` to store the result and `prev_value` to keep track of the previous character's value.\n3. We iterate through the string in reverse order. For each character:\n   - If the current value is less than the previous value, it means we have a subtractive combination (e.g., \"IV\"), so we subtract the current value from `total`.\n   - Otherwise, we add the current value to `total`.\n4. Finally, we return the `total`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_evens(l, r):\n    total = 0\n    for num in range(l, r + 1):\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nl = 1\nr = 10\nanswer = sum_of_evens(l, r)\nprint(f\"\\boxed{{{answer}}}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `sum_of_evens` takes two arguments, `l` (the lower bound) and `r` (the upper bound).\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of even numbers.\n3. **Iteration**: A `for` loop iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive).\n4. **Check for Even Numbers**: Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current number `num` is even by using the modulus operator `%`.\n5. **Summation**: If the number is even, it is added to `total`.\n6. **Return the Result**: The function returns the total sum of even numbers.\n7. **Example Usage**: The function is called with `l = 1` and `r = 10`, and the result is stored in `answer` and printed in the required format.\n\n### Output:\nFor the example where `l = 1` and `r = 10`, the sum of even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) is 30.\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Instead of iterating through all numbers, it uses the arithmetic sequence formula\n2. It handles edge cases properly\n3. It adjusts the bounds to work with even numbers only\n4.
