The sentence starts by calling \"The Four Feathers\" \"definitely horse feathers\", which is a colloquialism for something being of poor quality. This is a negative statement.\n2. However, the sentence then suggests that despite this, you \"might have fun\" if you approach it with the right mindset. This implies that the film has some redeeming qualities or that it can be enjoyable in a certain way.\n\nGiven these two points, the overall sentiment of the sentence is not entirely negative. It's more of a nuanced, mixed sentiment. The sentence is acknowledging the potential flaws of the film, but also suggesting that it can still be enjoyable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{1}",
