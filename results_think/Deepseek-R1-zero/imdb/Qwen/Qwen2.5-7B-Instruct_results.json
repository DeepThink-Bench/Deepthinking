Let us break down the main points mentioned in the review:\n\n1. \"Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was??\" - This part indicates that the reviewer did not understand the point of the film and seems frustrated or confused about the film's purpose.\n\n2. \"V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick... Round and Round and Round.... You get the idea...\" - The reviewer mentions that the camera movements made them feel physically sick and had to look away from the screen. This part clearly shows a negative reaction to the film's cinematography.\n\n3. \"VERY VERY Strange accents at many points.... 'Those that should know, know'\" - The reviewer also criticizes the \"strange accents\" used in the film, which seems to be another negative point.\n\n4. \"Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...\" - The reviewer concludes by advising that unless you are getting in for free, being paid to watch it, or if the alternative is something unpleasant like painting the house, you should forget about watching the film. This part strongly suggests that the reviewer does not recommend watching the film unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the review is clearly negative. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, the question states that if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nBased on the negative sentiment of the review, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Typically, a rating such as \"1/2\" out of a possible 4 or 5 stars is a very poor rating. For instance, if the rating is out of 4 stars, \"1/2\" star is a very low rating. Another common rating scale is out of 5 stars where \"1/2\" star would also be a very low rating. However, here it seems like a rating out of 5 stars where \"1/2\" star is a very negative review.\n\nBased on the negative descriptors (\"sloppily directed,\" \"witless comedy,\" \"no better than\" the \"classic\" 50s \"alien invasion\" films, \"doomed to fail,\" \"screeching voices,\" \"begging for some peace and quiet,\" and a poor rating of \"1/2\" star), the overall sentiment of the sentence is clearly negative.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets.

The reviewer mentions that the movie is \"below average,\" has a \"made for TV feel,\" and makes several other negative observations such as a \"corny theme song\" and a \"below average slasher\" that \"isn't too memorable.\" The only positive part seems to be a minor \"bright side\" comment about the release of obscure movies on DVD.\n\nBased on the overall negative tone of the review, the answer should be classified as negative.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, the question states that a positive answer should be represented as \"1\" and a negative answer should be represented as \"0\". \n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, let us make sure that the \"**/*****\" part of the question is interpreted correctly.

The author starts by saying, \"I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, especially 1997's 'Henry Fool.'\" This indicates a positive sentiment towards the director and a specific film by him.\n\n2. The text mentions that \"Fay Grim\" is a sequel to \"Henry Fool\" and that it \"has a similar style and sense of humor.\" Given that the author admires \"Henry Fool,\" a similar style and sense of humor in \"Fay Grim\" would likely be viewed positively.\n\n3. The text mentions that \"The plot, however, is completely different.\" This statement is neutral; it simply states a fact about the plot's difference from the first film.\n\n4. The text praises Parker Posey's performance as \"brilliant\" and refers to her as \"iconic.\" This is a positive statement about the lead actress's performance.\n\n5. The text describes the supporting cast as \"excellent\" and mentions that \"the film has lots of surprises.\" Both of these are positive statements.\n\n6. The text mentions that the director claims \"Fay Grim\" is part of a \"Star Wars\"-like trilogy where it serves as the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the series.

The last sentence, \"I just hope I don't have to wait 10 more years for it,\" expresses a desire for the third installment to be released sooner rather than later. This shows a positive eagerness for the next part of the series.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment expressed in the text about the film \"Fay Grim\" is positive. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given sentence is positive or negative, we need to analyze the text carefully.\n\nThe text states:\n\n\"This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.\"\n\nLet us break down the key parts of the text:\n\n1. \"This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family.\"\n   - The word \"touching\" here usually has a positive connotation, implying that the story is emotionally moving in a positive way.\n\n2. \"Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons.\"\n   - This part provides a description of the plot and the main characters. It seems neutral in terms of sentiment.\n\n3. \"The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn.\"\n   - The phrase \"well drawn\" here means that the characters are well-developed and well-portrayed, which is a positive statement about the quality of the film.\n\n4. \"The story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.\"\n   - The phrase \"consistently interesting\" is a positive statement about the story's ability to keep the viewer engaged. However, the part \"if a bit bleak\" indicates that the story might have a somber or depressing tone. However, \"bleak\" itself is a negative term, but it is used here as a minor qualifier (\"a bit bleak\") to an otherwise positive statement (\"consistently interesting\").\n\nBased on the overall analysis, the text seems to be mostly positive about the film. The only part that could be seen as negative is the \"a bit bleak\" part, but that seems to be a minor part of an otherwise positive review where the main points (\"touching story,\" \"well drawn\" portraits, and \"consistently interesting\" story) are positive.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, let us make sure that the \"a bit bleak\" part does not make the overall sentiment negative. The \"a bit bleak\" part seems to be a minor part of an otherwise positive review. Thus, the overall sentiment seems to be positive.\n\nHowever, a \"bleak\" story might make some people feel that the review is negative. However, \"bleak\" here seems to be a description of the story's tone rather than a negative judgment on the quality of the film itself. \n\nHowever, a \"touching\" story and \"well drawn\" characters are positive descriptors.

No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood.\"\n   - The reviewer seems to be pointing out that the film lacks elements that might make it more appealing (such as nudity and \"sufficient buckets of blood\"), which could be a negative point for a horror film.\n\n5. \"All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher.'\"\n   - The phrase \"unfortunate fact\" indicates that the reviewer is disappointed that the film does not deliver on the \"sensations\" one might expect from a horror film.\n\n6. \"Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension.\"\n   - The word \"only\" here suggests that the soundtrack is the only part of the film that provides any \"palpable tension,\" which implies that other parts of the film fail to do so.\n\n7. \"Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions that some visual elements (\"static storyboarded compositions\" and \"appealing low-angles\") add to the \"malaise,\" which could be a positive point, but the main point here is that the reviewer did not find the film scary (\"I did not even get close to flinching once\"), which is a negative point for a horror film.\n\n8. \"Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.\"\n   - The reviewer suggests that some changes might have \"improved my opinion,\" but concludes that \"this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest,\" which clearly indicates a negative overall opinion of the film.\n\nBased on the analysis of the text, the overall sentiment expressed is negative. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The reviewer mentions that they enjoyed the book and decided to watch the movie because they were home sick on the couch. \n\nThe reviewer makes several observations about the movie:\n1. \"The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.\"\n2. \"The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore?

The reviewer mentions that they enjoyed the book and that watching the movie seemed like a good idea because they were home sick. This part seems neutral to slightly positive because they had a positive memory of the book.\n2. The reviewer makes a few negative comments about the movie:\n    - The actors are \"grade B actors and actresses,\" which is a negative comment about the quality of the cast.\n    - The female cast is described as \"right out of Desperate Housewives\" and questions if there is \"nothing original anymore,\" which seems like a negative comment about the lack of originality.\n    - The male cast is described as \"fairly effeminate looking and acting,\" which seems like a negative comment about the male actors' appearances and acting.\n    - The reviewer makes a sarcastic comment about a scene where a female character kicks a male character in the testicles, which seems to be a negative comment about the clich\u00e9d action and the reviewer's opinion that such a move is \"not as easy as it's always made to look.\"\n3. However, the reviewer does make a positive comment towards the end: \"It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.\" This indicates that there were some positive aspects to the movie.\n\nBased on the overall tone of the review, the negative comments seem to outweigh the positive ones. However, the question is whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. \n\nThe question states that if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nThe main question here is whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. The reviewer makes a few negative comments about the movie's cast, originality, and a specific scene. However, the reviewer also mentions that they enjoyed the book and that the movie \"wasn't all bad\" because it gave them \"chills a time or two.\" \n\nHowever, the part where the reviewer says \"It wasn't all bad\" suggests that the overall sentiment might be a mix of positive and negative, but leaning more towards negative because the phrase \"It wasn't all bad\" usually implies that the overall experience was mostly negative with a few positive aspects. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice here. The most important part here is that the reviewer mentions that the movie \"wasn't all bad\" and that they \"did get the chills a time or two,\" which seems to be a positive note. However, the majority of the review seems to be negative. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice here.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)<br /><br />The world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.<br /><br />It is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.<br /><br />She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.<br /><br />Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer, who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.<br /><br />The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.<br /><br />I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time.

To identify the sentiment, let us break down the key points mentioned:\n\n1. The text starts by describing Hedy Lamarr as \"the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen\" and mentions that her appearance in the film was \"the start of a legendary career.\" These are positive descriptions.\n\n2. The text mentions that \"Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty.\" This is a positive comment on the director's work and Lamarr's performance.\n\n3.

The text mentions that the film was \"considered shocking for its time\" and \"some thought it to be scandalous,\" which might seem negative, but the context here is that the controversy made the film a \"must-see\" film.

The text describes the romantic scenes as \"blatant waves of eroticism\" and \"beautiful work\" by Machaty. Another positive comment on the director's work.\n\n7. The text mentions that Lamarr's performance was \"brave\" and that it \"gained her worldwide fame\" and a contract with MGM. Another positive statement.\n\n8.

Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him.\"\n   - This part seems to be a neutral description of the cast and characters in the movie.\n\n2. \"This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie they made was basically the same but set in a different time.\"\n   - This part mentions that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together for the first time here and that their next movie was \"basically the same but set in a different time.\" The phrase \"basically the same\" could be interpreted as a neutral or slightly negative comment if the reviewer implies a lack of originality in the next movie, but it does not directly comment on the quality of the current movie.\n\n3. \"This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war.\"\n   - Another neutral description of the movie's plot.\n\n4. \"Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home.\"\n   - Another neutral description of a part of the movie's plot.\n\n5. \"This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate.\"\n   - The statement \"is far from accurate\" could be seen as a negative comment on the historical accuracy of the movie. However, historical inaccuracy might not necessarily make a movie bad if it is still entertaining or well-made.\n\n6. \"Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.\"\n   - \"Gary Cooper is good as usual\" is a positive statement about Gary Cooper's performance. The part \"i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here\" indicates that the reviewer usually does not like Jean Arthur's performances but liked her in this particular movie, which is a positive statement about her performance in this specific context.\n\nBased on the last statement (\"Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here\"), it seems that the reviewer has a generally positive view of the actors' performances in this movie. However, the only part that could be interpreted as a negative comment is that the movie is \"far from accurate\" in its depiction of Custer's last stand. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the overall sentiment of the text is positive or negative. The main part that seems to express a personal opinion about the movie itself is the last sentence where the reviewer says, \"Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.\" This part seems to be a positive sentiment about the main actors' performances. \n\nHowever, the question is about the overall sentiment of the text. The only part that seems negative is the part about the movie being \"far from accurate,\" which might be a minor negative point compared to the positive comments about the actors' performances. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice based on the overall sentiment. The part where the reviewer says \"i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here\" seems to be a significant positive statement. \n\nBased on the given text, the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards a positive sentiment because the reviewer makes a point of saying that they liked Jean Arthur in this movie despite usually not liking her, and that Gary Cooper was \"good as usual.\" \n\nHowever, a more balanced way to interpret the overall sentiment might be:\n- Positive points: \"Gary Cooper is good as usual\" and \"i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.\"\n- Negative point: \"This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate.\"\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice. The part where the reviewer says \"i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here\" seems to be a significant positive statement. \n\nBased on the given text, the overall sentiment seems to be positive. Thus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, a more in-depth check might be needed here. Another part that might be interpreted as a negative is the part where the reviewer mentions that the next movie DeMille and Cooper made was \"basically the same but set in a different time.\" However, that part seems to be a comment on a different movie rather than the one being reviewed here.\n\nHowever, a more \"negative\" part might be the \"far from accurate\" part.

The reviewer makes several statements that need to be interpreted for their sentiment.\n\n1. \"I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie. Its a big joke.\"\n   - The phrase \"any sense of sense in this movie\" suggests that the reviewer thinks the movie lacks a coherent plot or makes little sense. The statement \"It's a big joke\" could be interpreted as a negative comment, implying that the movie is not to be taken seriously and might be seen as ridiculous or nonsensical.\n\n2. \"Good.. Its entertaining .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film.\"\n   - The word \"Good\" might initially seem positive, but it seems to be followed by a more sarcastic tone. The reviewer says \"It's entertaining,\" which could be a positive comment, but the next part \"You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film\" is clearly negative. The term \"most stupid plot\" is a strong negative descriptor.\n\n3. \"I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.\"\n   - This statement seems to express confusion or doubt about the intended audience for the movie, which could be interpreted as a negative comment about the movie's appeal or target demographic.\n\n4. \"Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.\"\n   - This part seems to be a neutral description of the movie's plot followed by a speculative question about a real-life scenario. However, the question itself seems to be a bit critical or skeptical about the plausibility of the plot.\n\n5. \"Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance. When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras.\"\n   - The first part is a neutral description of a part of the plot where Rani's character is happy about another woman (Preity) being brought in to make a child for her and Salman. However, the part \"When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras\" is a negative comment about Salman Khan's acting or his character's behavior (\"nakhras\" refers to his antics or tantrums).\n\n6. \"Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.\"\n   - The phrase \"Though a good past-time\" might seem a bit positive, but it is immediately followed by \"this movie is unbearable\" which is a very negative statement. The word \"Absurd\" at the end also reinforces a negative sentiment.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the text appears to be negative. The reviewer makes several negative comments about the movie's plot, its target audience, and Salman Khan's \"nakhras,\" and concludes that the movie is \"unbearable\" and \"absurd.\"\n\nBased on the question statement, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1; if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The reviewer here is expressing disapproval towards another reviewer who \"dissed\" (i.e., criticized negatively) the movie. This implies that the current reviewer disagrees with the negative review and thus has a positive view of the movie.\n\n3. \"A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy.\" - The phrase \"sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy\" clearly indicates a positive sentiment about the movie.\n\n4. \"Paulie is a lovable little treasure.\" - The phrase \"lovable little treasure\" is a very positive description of the main character, Paulie.\n\n5. \"He has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh.\" - The fact that Paulie's lines made the reviewer laugh indicates that the reviewer found the movie humorous and enjoyable.\n\n6. \"I especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint.\" - The phrase \"I especially loved\" indicates a positive reaction to a part of the movie.\n\n7. \"You can forgive the obvious clich\u00e9s as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie.\" - The phrase \"cheer him on in his quest\" indicates that the reviewer is emotionally invested in Paulie's journey and finds it engaging. Although the reviewer mentions \"obvious clich\u00e9s,\" the statement \"you can forgive\" suggests that the positive aspects outweigh any negative clich\u00e9s.\n\n8. \"A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner.\" - The word \"charming\" is a positive descriptor for the movie.\n\n9. \"Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share Paulie's reunion.\" - This part expresses a minor negative point where the reviewer wishes that a particular character had a more significant part in the story. However, this is more of a wish for more content rather than a negative critique of the existing content.\n\n10. \"Bless Paulie in his new home, at last with Marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.\" - The phrase \"Bless Paulie in his new home\" is a positive and warm sentiment, expressing happiness for Paulie's reunion with Marie.\n\nBased on the analysis of the text, the overall sentiment expressed is overwhelmingly positive.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart - in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a \"I trust only myself\" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he (as Jeff Webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). <br /><br />He meets his match in Skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a so-called law man named Gannon (John McIntyre) who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the \"Gold Rush\" Jefferson \"Soapy\" Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for Gannon's profit). <br /><br />Stewart is partner with Ben (Walter Brennan - who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean). They are also joined by Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvert). Rhonda works closely with Gannon, but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However, she has a similar \"I only trust myself\" attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He, Ben, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border, although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him.<br /><br />The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson, Jeff opting for a longer and safer route. After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach Dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. The herd is sold to Rhonda, and Jeff, Ben, Rube, and Renee start prospecting. There is soon two groups in the town of Dawson. One led by Connie Gilchrist and Chubby Johnson want to build a decent town. But the Mounties won't be setting up a station in Dawson for months. The other, centering around the \"dancehall\" run by Rhonda, are in cahoots with Gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (Robert J. Wilke - really scary in one sequence with Chubby Johnson and Jay C. Flippen, Jack Elam, and Harry Morgan). Jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and Ben for a ranch they want in Utah. But will they get there? And will Jeff remain neutral?<br /><br />The performances are dandy here, including Stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. Brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. Flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab Stewart in the heart using Stewart's own words against him. McIntyre would achieve stardom on television in WAGON TRAIN replacing Ward Bond, but his work in Mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in WINCHESTER '73). He is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. Roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. And Calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier \"Gigi\" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.<br /><br />Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by John Ford.

A positive sentiment should be labeled as \"1\" and a negative sentiment should be labeled as \"0\".\n\nLet us break down the sentence into parts and analyze the sentiment of each part:\n\n1. \"Warning: contains a spoiler.\" - This part is a neutral statement that serves as a warning about spoilers in the review itself.\n2. \"Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.\" - This part is clearly negative (\"corny plot\" and \"terrible acting\" are negative descriptions).\n3. \"Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden.\" - This part is mixed. \"Fontaine is great\" is positive, while \"some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden\" is negative (\"wooden\" acting means stiff or unnatural, which is a negative description).\n4. \"Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place.\" - This part seems to be a description of a scene in the movie and might be a negative comment on the unrealistic nature of the scene (\"dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place\" could be a criticism of the lack of realism).\n5. \"Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful.\" - The word \"yet\" indicates a contrast to the previous negative comments. \"Juicy\" and \"suspenseful\" are positive descriptions.\n6. \"More faithful to the book than most movies of its era.\" - This part is positive (\"faithful to the book\" is usually seen as a positive attribute for a movie adaptation).\n7. \"Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke.\" - \"Masterful stroke\" is a positive description.\n8. \"She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self.\" - This part seems neutral or slightly positive if \"usual Joan Fontainey self\" is a good thing.\n9. \"As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling 'feet foremost through the floor into an empty space.'\" - This part seems to be a description of a scene in the movie and is neutral.\n\nBased on the analysis, the text contains a mix of positive and negative comments. However, the question is asking us to make a binary decision on whether the overall sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0).\n\nThe key part here is that the text mentions negative aspects such as a \"corny plot\" and \"terrible acting,\" but it also mentions positive aspects such as \"Fontaine is great,\" \"the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful,\" \"more faithful to the book,\" and \"casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner was a masterful stroke.\"\n\nTo make a well-rounded decision, we need to weigh the positive and negative comments. The negative comments are about the plot and acting (excluding Fontaine), while the positive comments are about Fontaine's performance, the movie being \"juicy\" and \"suspenseful,\" its faithfulness to the book, and a \"masterful stroke\" in casting. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice based on the overall sentiment. The \"yet\" in the sentence \"Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful\" seems to be a turning point where the reviewer transitions from negative to positive comments. \n\nBased on the \"yet\" and the positive comments that follow (\"juicy and suspenseful,\" \"faithful to the book,\" \"masterful stroke\"), it seems that the reviewer, despite acknowledging some negative aspects, still has a positive overall sentiment about the movie. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, a more careful check should make us verify that the positive comments seem to outweigh the negative ones here. \n\nHowever, a more \"balanced\" review might make us question if the \"\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

However, the overall sentiment leans more towards the positive due to the strong praise for Joan Fontaine's performance, the movie's faithfulness to the book, and its suspenseful nature.

            "question": "Given the question statement:Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like \"Tarzan\" and \"The Emperor's New Groove\" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. \"Atlantis\" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of \"The Little Mermaid\" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clich\u00e9d Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clich\u00e9d as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, \"The Little Mermaid\" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clich\u00e9d film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths \u0096 a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clich\u00e9s, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale \u0096 need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone \u0096 I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.<br /><br />But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent \"Titan A.E.\" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, \"Nadia\", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.<br /><br />With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clich\u00e9d tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).<br /><br />This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film \u0096 after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment about the film \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire,\" we need to analyze the main points made in the review.\n\nThe text starts by mentioning that Disney has been trying to diversify its films and that \"Atlantis\" is a bold step in a new direction for Disney. The reviewer mentions that \"Atlantis\" is Disney's first serious film and that it is rated PG, which might have scared off some families. \n\nHowever, the reviewer makes several positive points about the film:\n1. The reviewer acknowledges that the plot is \"potentially detailed\" but is \"condensed into a 96-minute movie,\" which makes the first half-hour feel a bit rushed. However, the reviewer advises us to \"suspend your disbelief\" about how quickly characters move from one point to another.\n2. The reviewer mentions that the love story between Milo Thatch and Kida is \"not as clich\u00e9d as I was expecting\" and that it is \"far more subdued\" compared to other Disney films like \"The Little Mermaid,\" which the reviewer sees as a \"good thing.\"\n3. The reviewer acknowledges that the film is \"rather clich\u00e9d\" with characters that \"emulate something that has been done a thousand times before.\" However, the reviewer finds the \"tongue-in-cheek nature\" of the film \"quite amusing\" and appreciates that the writers have tried to come up with \"consistently witty dialogue\" that is sometimes \"a little inspired.\"\n4. The reviewer praises the \"big stunning visuals\" and \"truly amazing\" CGI animation that \"doesn't dwarf the characters,\" unlike \"Titan A.E.\" The visual presentation is also noted for its anime style.\n5. The sound design is described as a \"treat\" with a \"dynamic musical score\" that \"compliments the film in every way.\"\n6. The reviewer concludes by saying that the film is an \"adventure thrill ride\" with a \"more serious tone than any Disney film before it.\" The reviewer also mentions that the mythology in \"Atlantis\" is \"far more correct\" than in other Disney films like \"Hercules.\"\n7. The reviewer explicitly states that this is a \"positive, 10 out of 10 review\" and that they were \"blown away by this film.\" \n\nBased on the overall tone and the specific positive comments made throughout the review, it is clear that the sentiment expressed in the text is positive. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Unfortunately, it's technically good and I gave it 4/10, but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it 'entertainment'. Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.\"\n\nLet us break down the sentence into key parts:\n\n1. \"Repugnant Bronson thriller.\" - The word \"repugnant\" means extremely distasteful or unacceptable. This part clearly has a negative connotation.\n\n2. \"Unfortunately, it's technically good and I gave it 4/10.\" - The word \"unfortunately\" suggests that the speaker is about to mention something positive (\"it's technically good\") that they wish wasn't true because they seem to have a negative overall opinion of the film. However, \"technically good\" could be a positive comment on some aspects of the film's production quality. The part \"I gave it 4/10\" indicates a low rating (out of 10), which is a negative assessment of the film overall.\n\n3. \"But it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it 'entertainment'.\" - The phrase \"utterly vile\" is a very strong negative description. The part \"it would be inconceivable to call it 'entertainment'\" further emphasizes that the film is not enjoyable or entertaining, which is another negative statement.\n\n4. \"Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film.\" - This part compares the film to a \"typical slasher film,\" which is already a genre known for being disturbing. Saying that this film is \"far more disturbing\" than a typical slasher film makes it sound even more negative.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sentence is filled with negative descriptions such as \"repugnant,\" \"vile,\" \"inconceivable to call it 'entertainment',\" and \"far more disturbing.\" The only part that seems positive is \"it's technically good,\" but this is prefaced with \"unfortunately\" and seems to be a minor positive point that is overshadowed by the overwhelmingly negative comments.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the overall sentiment of the sentence is negative.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, let us make sure that the question statement makes sense.

Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case?

Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience.

This part is also negative.\n\n3. \"As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case?

The author mentions that there are \"jump\" moments where they only thought \"yeah, I didn't expect that\" without actually being scared or \"jumping in the slightest,\" which implies that the movie failed to effectively scare or surprise the author.\n\n5. The author criticizes the resolution of the movie, saying that it \"doesn't make sense\" because the force behind the events seems capable of doing things directly, so it shouldn't need a proxy.

It could be interpreted as a negative statement about \"A-list actors,\" but it seems to be a positive statement about the actual cast of the movie, implying that the cast did a great job where \"A-list actors\" might not have been able to.\n\n5. \"Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.\"\n   - This part is a personal reflection and is neutral in terms of sentiment about the movie itself.\n\n6. \"It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.\"\n   - Another statement of fact about the movie's content, which is neutral.\n\n7. \"As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.\"\n   - This part describes the realistic portrayal of characters who had fears and emotions, which seems to be a positive comment on the movie's realistic and humanizing portrayal of soldiers.\n\n8. \"They were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life, I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either--but I'll never forget them--should have stayed in touch.\"\n   - This part is a personal reflection on the reviewer's own military experiences and is mostly neutral in terms of the movie's sentiment.\n\n9. \"I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afghanistan.\"\n   - \"I highly recommend it\" is a very positive statement about the movie.\n   - The part about \"think about those serving present day in Afghanistan\" is a call to action which is neutral in terms of the movie's sentiment.\n\n10. \"Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need 'sensitivity training' HA!HA!HA!\"\n   - This part seems to be a humorous comment about basic training and drill sergeants, which is neutral in terms of the movie's sentiment.\n\nBased on the analysis, the main positive statements include:\n   - \"Great movie, perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.\"\n   - \"No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.\" (which is a positive statement about the movie in question)\n   - \"I highly recommend it.\"\n\nThe main negative statement seems to be \"Never heard of this movie,\" which is more neutral than negative.

From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the \"southern\" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \"Faith\". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan.

The reviewer mentions that the \"spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago.\" This seems like a light-hearted comment and not a main point of the review's sentiment.\n\n2. The reviewer states, \"I'll preface by saying I'm not a fan of narrated episodes.\" This indicates a negative sentiment towards narrated episodes specifically.\n\n3. The reviewer continues, \"If the story/actors/etc. are worth their salt, they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out, reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters.\" This part is a criticism of the episode's reliance on narration, which the reviewer finds unnecessary and a sign of poor storytelling or acting.\n\n4. The reviewer says, \"The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup O tea.\" Here, the reviewer describes part of the episode as \"tedious and boring,\" which is a clear negative comment.\n\n5. The reviewer suggests an alternative: \"They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something.\" This part suggests that the reviewer thinks the episode could have been improved, which implies dissatisfaction with the current state of the episode.\n\n6. The reviewer mentions \"Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house, which has a singular half circle driveway, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under, because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property.\" This part criticizes what the reviewer perceives as a \"sloppy editing\" mistake.\n\n7. The reviewer also mentions, \"Sloppy editing, as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house?\" Another point about \"sloppy editing\" is made here.\n\n8. The reviewer criticizes the \"dolly close-ups\" as \"overdone, like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time.\" Another negative comment about the episode's production quality.\n\n9. The reviewer says, \"I could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was.\" This statement directly calls the episode \"boring.\"\n\n10. The reviewer mentions that the episode \"kept dragging on\" and that \"the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible.\" Another negative comment about the episode's pacing and content.\n\n11. The reviewer makes a sarcastic comment: \"I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player, automatic top etc.\" This part seems to mock the episode for what seems like an excessive focus on a car.\n\n12. The reviewer concludes with, \"The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends, abruptly. No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or terminated. Not that many would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end.\" The only \"good thing\" mentioned here is that the episode ends abruptly, which is not a positive comment about the episode itself but rather a relief that it ends. The reviewer also suggests that most viewers would have \"changed the channel or dozed off by the end,\" which is a very negative remark about the episode's ability to keep viewers engaged.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

However, the last sentence mentions that the replacement of Richard Dean Anderson (RDA) in seasons 9-10 \"was enough to take the heart out of the show,\" which indicates a negative sentiment specifically about those later seasons.\n\nThe second paragraph states:\n\"The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous.

If it is negative, the answer should be 0.\n\nLet us break down the main points mentioned in the review:\n1. \"This movie was boring!\" - This is a direct negative statement about the movie.\n2. \"Yes, there are a few funny moments and jokes, but you cannot base a whole movie on that!\" - The \"but\" here indicates that despite a few positive aspects (funny moments and jokes), the overall sentiment is negative because a few funny moments are not enough to make a good movie.\n3. \"The characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters, who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine.\" - This part criticizes the characters as being stereotyped and mentions that there is no real story, only short episodes with \"freaky\" side-characters that fail to make the plot feel genuine. This is another negative point.\n4. \"Shame, because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles.\" - The reviewer expresses disappointment that well-known actors took part in what seems to be a subpar movie. This part also has a negative connotation.\n5. \"This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film.\" - Another negative statement, indicating that the movie does not bring any new hope for Hungarian cinema.\n6. \"It was boring, though it was meant to be genuine or unique.\" - The reviewer reiterates that the movie was boring and did not achieve what it was meant to be (genuine or unique).\n7. \"They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10\" - The reviewer gives the movie a rating of 2 out of 10, which is a very low score, reinforcing the negative sentiment.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall sentiment of the review is clearly negative. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "\\boxed{0}\n\nThe review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing various aspects of the movie including its boring nature, stereotypical characters, lack of a real story, and poor execution.

The text makes several points:\n\n1. The plot is described as a \"holiday horror\" category that fills the shelves of your local video store.\n2. The plot is described as a \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him,\" which is a familiar trope.\n3. The text mentions that those who have seen the movie before will probably watch it again.\n4. The text mentions that those who are expecting a highbrow film like Ingmar Bergman might be indignant about their wasted time and should skip it.\n5. The text mentions that the movie features Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and actors like David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, and Katherine Heigl as \"eye candy.\"\n6. The text advises the reader to \"go with the flow and enjoy it.\"\n7. The text mentions that the reviewer loved the creepy mask.\n\nBased on the given text, the main question is whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative. \n\nThe text seems to make a few positive remarks such as:\n- \"Those who've seen it before will probably watch it again.\"\n- \"Go with the flow and enjoy it.\"\n- \"Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.\"\n\nHowever, there are also some neutral or potentially negative remarks such as:\n- \"The 'wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him' plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before.\" (This seems neutral or a bit negative if it implies that the plot is clich\u00e9.)\n- \"Those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it.\" (This seems to imply that the movie is not highbrow and might be a waste of time for those expecting a serious film.)\n\nHowever, the part that seems to make a clear positive statement is \"go with the flow and enjoy it,\" which directly suggests that the reviewer is advising the reader to enjoy the movie.

The first part (\"Another entry in the 'holiday horror' category that fills the shelves of your local video store\") seems neutral.\n2. The part about the \"wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him\" plot being familiar seems neutral or slightly negative if it implies a clich\u00e9 plot.\n3. The part about \"those who've seen it before will probably watch it again\" seems positive because it suggests that the movie is worth rewatching.\n4. The part about \"those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it\" seems to be a warning that the movie is not a highbrow film, which could be seen as a negative remark for those who prefer such films, but it also sets an expectation that the movie is more of a \"fun\" or \"entertaining\" film rather than a serious one.\n5. The part mentioning \"Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, and Katherine Heigl as eye candy\" seems to be a positive remark because it highlights some appealing features of the movie (\"eye candy\" is usually a positive term for attractive actors).\n6. The part \"go with the flow and enjoy it\" is a clear positive recommendation.\n7. \"Oh, and I loved the creepy mask\" is another positive remark.\n\nBased on the positive statements such as \"go with the flow and enjoy it\" and \"I loved the creepy mask,\" the overall sentiment appears to be positive. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Probably the first and last time on the screen.\"\n   - This part seems to be a neutral or slightly negative comment about a specific part of the film, but it does not directly reflect on the overall sentiment of the review.\n\n6. \"I recommend this film and now own the DVD.\"\n   - The phrase \"I recommend this film\" clearly indicates a positive sentiment. Additionally, the fact that the reviewer now owns the DVD also suggests a positive sentiment towards the film.\n\nBased on the key phrases such as \"very good Mann flick,\" \"John McIntire is excellent,\" and \"I recommend this film and now own the DVD,\" the overall sentiment of the review appears to be positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

It's not going to be the Japanese version.\n\nThe show is great. I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch... From the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman.

It's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize.\n\nOh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef...\n\nAla Cuisine!\"\n\nLet us break down the main points mentioned in the text:\n\n1. \"It's a cooking competition show, Americanized. It's not going to be the Japanese version.\"\n   - This part seems to be a neutral statement describing what the show is and how it differs from the Japanese version.\n\n2. \"The show is great.\"\n   - This is a clear positive statement about the show.\n\n3. \"I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch... From the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman. Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV.\"\n   - \"I could care less about cooking\" means that the author does not have a strong interest in cooking itself. However, the phrase \"I could care less\" is often used colloquially to mean \"I couldn't care less,\" which means that the author has very little interest in cooking. However, the main point here is that despite not being interested in cooking, the author finds the show \"entertaining to watch\" and mentions \"intensity put into the dishes by the chef\" and the \"goofy chairman\" as positive aspects. The statement \"Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV\" is another positive statement.\n\n4. \"You could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge... But... Meh. It's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize.\"\n   - The first part mentions a potential critique (\"having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge\"), but the \"But... Meh\" part seems to dismiss that critique as not very important. The statement \"It's entertaining enough to watch\" is again a positive statement, and \"generally the winner deserves the prize\" is also a positive comment about the show's fairness.\n\n5. \"Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef...\"\n   - The word \"bitter\" here indicates a negative feeling about John Besh not being the new Iron Chef. However, this seems to be a personal grievance about a specific individual rather than a critique of the show itself.\n\n6. \"Ala Cuisine!\"\n   - This seems to be a playful sign-off and does not contribute significantly to the sentiment analysis.\n\nBased on the main points, the text contains several positive statements such as \"The show is great,\" \"entertaining to watch,\" \"Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV,\" and \"It's entertaining enough to watch.\" The only negative part seems to be a personal grievance about John Besh not being the new Iron Chef, which does not directly criticize the show itself.\n\nBased on the overall positive statements about the show, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n(1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment).\n\nHowever, a more in-depth check on the phrase \"I could care less\" might need a bit of a second look. The phrase \"I could care less\" is often used incorrectly when people mean \"I couldn't care less.\" \"I couldn't care less\" means that one's level of care is already at the minimum, so it cannot be any lower. However, \"I could care less\" means that one still has some level of care that could be reduced. However, in American English, \"I could care less\" is often used interchangeably with \"I couldn't care less\" to express a lack of interest. \n\nHowever, the main part here is that the author says \"I could care less about cooking,\" which means that the author is not very interested in cooking itself, but still finds the show \"entertaining to watch.\" Thus, the part \"I could care less about cooking\" should not be interpreted as a negative sentiment towards the show itself.\n\nBased on the overall positive tone about the show itself, the answer should indeed be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

However, the part \"It didn't help the film any\" suggests that even in that state, the movie was not enjoyable. \n\n2. \"The film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil) I shall let your imagination figure out the 'Zany' (and I use that word lightly) antics that follow.\"\n   - The reviewer describes the plot briefly and uses the word \"Zany\" in quotes and adds \"(and I use that word lightly).\" This suggests that the reviewer does not actually find the antics in the movie to be \"zany\" or amusing. The part \"not that there was anything to spoil\" implies that the movie's plot is not very engaging or significant.\n\n3. \"I had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and I would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.\"\n   - The phrase \"I had to fight to stay awake\" indicates that the movie was very boring (\"snore a minute sleeper of a film\"). The reviewer strongly advises against watching the movie (\"if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't\"), and says that \"it's a waste of the film it was printed on,\" which is a very negative statement about the movie's quality.\n\n4. \"Then again I could be wrong...\"\n   - This is a common phrase used to suggest that the reviewer acknowledges that their opinion might not be universally shared, but it does not change the negative sentiment expressed previously.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the review is clearly negative. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a caf\u00e9 in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam's is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam's. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers.

The second sentence states, \"Beneath the veneer, it is MGM character actor stunt-casting at its funniest.\" The term \"stunt-casting\" refers to casting well-known actors in roles that are against their usual type. The phrase \"at its funniest\" suggests that this casting choice is seen as a positive and humorous aspect of the film.\n\n3. The next part mentions that the leads are \"straightforward,\" but that \"all the secondaries are cast much against type.\" The text then provides examples such as Margaret Hamilton (known for her role as the Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (known for playing a \"professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget\"), and Sig Ruman (known for being a nemesis in Marx Brothers' films). The text states that these actors are \"playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their 'usual' characters would do.\" \n\n4. The text continues by saying that the film \"pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions,\" which makes it seem like a \"wry send-up\" of post-war romantic comedies and their \"2-dimensional, stock characters.\" A \"send-up\" is a parody or a mockery, which could be seen as a positive if it is done well and is humorous.\n\n5. The author mentions that they have only seen the movie once and with interruptions, so they are not entirely sure, but they suggest that the movie might have been more effective when it was first released because viewers at that time might have had a different perception of the secondary characters. \n\n6.

The speaker mentions \"hating this film, hating myself and even hating the French actress,\" which strongly indicates a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, the text then says:\n\"And then... I don't know what happened but I was pulled into the film in a way that I hadn't been in years. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand. I was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it.\"\n\nThis part indicates a significant shift in the speaker's feelings. The phrase \"I was pulled into the film in a way that I hadn't been in years\" suggests that the speaker became deeply engaged and enjoyed the film. The statement \"I was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it\" further emphasizes that the overall experience turned out to be positive.\n\nThe text concludes with:\n\"I believe that great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink. This film did that. It was one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had.\"\n\nThe speaker describes what they believe makes a great movie and then states that \"This film did that,\" which means that the speaker considers this film to be a great movie. The final sentence, \"It was one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had,\" makes it very clear that the overall sentiment is highly positive.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n(1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment).\n\nHowever, it seems that the question is asking us to make a binary choice based on the overall sentiment of the text.

The phrase \"worst movie I have ever seen\" is a strong negative statement.\n\nThe next part of the review states:\n> \"I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot.\"\n\nThis part also seems negative because the reviewer mentions that none of them understood the plot, which is a criticism of the movie's coherence or storytelling.\n\nThe review continues:\n> \"Aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the 'special effects' were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible.\"\n\nThis part lists several negative aspects such as \"lack of plot,\" \"acting was atrocious,\" \"special effects were not so special,\" and \"writing was absolutely horrible.\" All of these are strong negative comments about the movie.\n\nHowever, the review then mentions:\n> \"The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue.\"\n\nThis part suggests that the movie is so bad that it becomes funny in a \"so bad it's good\" way. The reviewer mentions that the movie's \"only redeeming factor\" is that it is \"so incredibly bad that it's quite funny,\" which makes it a candidate for a \"so bad it's good\" type of movie.\n\nThe review concludes with:\n> \"I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.\"\n\nThe reviewer explicitly states that they would not recommend the film to anyone looking for a good movie. However, they do suggest that a group of friends could watch it together and have a good laugh because of how bad it is. The \"1 out of 10\" rating further emphasizes that the reviewer thinks the movie is very bad.\n\nBased on the question statement, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nThe question now is to identify whether the overall sentiment of the review is positive or negative. \n\nThe main part of the review is overwhelmingly negative (\"worst movie I have ever seen,\" \"lack of plot,\" \"atrocious acting,\" \"not so special\" special effects, \"absolutely horrible\" writing, and a \"1 out of 10\" rating). However, the part where the reviewer mentions that the movie is so bad that it's funny might make us question if there is a \"positive\" aspect here. However, the question here is to identify the \"sentiment\" of the review. \n\nThe \"so bad it's good\" part might make us lean towards a \"mixed\" sentiment, but the question only allows us to classify the review as either \"positive\" (answer is 1) or \"negative\" (answer is 0). \n\nHowever, the \"1 out of 10\" rating makes it clear that the reviewer thinks the movie is very bad. The part where the reviewer mentions that the movie is \"so bad it's funny\" seems to be a minor \"redeeming factor\" mentioned only in the context of making fun of the movie's poor quality. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice based on the overall sentiment. The main part of the review is negative, so the answer should be \"negative\" which corresponds to an answer of 0. \n\nHowever, a more careful reading makes us realize that the question seems to be asking us to identify the \"sentiment\" of the review itself.

I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material.

The reviewer initially expected the movie to be of poor quality like a previous Modesty Blaise movie (\"schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie\"), which made them avoid watching it for a long time (\"left it unwatched for so long\").\n   - However, the reviewer mentions that they were \"very pleasantly surprised,\" which indicates that the movie exceeded their low expectations.\n\n2. \"Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.\"\n   - The reviewer contrasts their initial expectations (\"succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases\") with what the movie actually was (\"an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails\").\n   - The phrase \"almost thoughtful analysis\" suggests that the reviewer found depth and substance in the movie's character development (\"how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails\").\n   - The part \"with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized\" suggests that the reviewer appreciated the movie's balanced and well-executed storytelling.\n\n3. \"It's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching.\"\n   - The reviewer suggests that the \"budgetary constraints\" might have been beneficial because it led to less focus on action scenes (\"finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die\") and more focus on making the movie \"worth watching.\"\n\n4. \"Hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning?

A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver, Richard(Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous.

The text provides a summary of the plot where Richard, who dreams of human flight and builds an airplane in his garage, is tasked with taking care of Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that has left her mostly speechless and with very limited motor skills. \n\nThe main part of the plot that seems to be a focal point here is that Jane's \"last dying wish is to lose her virginity,\" and she offers herself to Richard. However, Richard is not willing to directly help her fulfill this wish but instead decides to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed.\n\nThe question asks us to determine whether the reviewer found the movie to be positive or negative based on the following statement:\n\n> \"I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.\"\n\nBased on the given statement, the reviewer makes a few key observations:\n1. The reviewer describes the movie as \"ambitious and humorous.\"\n2. The reviewer mentions that Helena Bonham Carter has a \"certain charisma and likability\" even in this role.\n\nThe question states that if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0.\n\nBased on the reviewer's statement, the words \"ambitious,\" \"humorous,\" \"charisma,\" and \"likability\" are all positive descriptors.

However, the part that directly states the reviewer's opinion is \"I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability,\" which is clearly positive.\n\nThus, the answer should indeed be 1 based on the given reasoning.\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further. <br /><br />Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird. At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her. Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction. <br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex? <br /><br />These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else. <br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material.

It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with.

We laughed until we cried.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment, we need to analyze the text carefully.\n\nThe text is a review of a horror film. The main question here is to identify if the sentiment expressed in the review is positive (answer should be 1) or negative (answer should be 0).\n\nLet us break down the text sentence by sentence:\n\n1. \"This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.\"\n   - Ed Wood is known for making what are often considered some of the worst films ever made. Thus, saying that a film is \"the best horror film made since Ed Wood died\" could be interpreted as a sarcastic way of saying that the film is very bad. However, it could also be interpreted as a genuine compliment if the reviewer actually means that the film is the best horror film made in a long time. However, the context here seems to lean towards sarcasm because Ed Wood's films are typically seen as \"so bad they're good\" or just plain bad.\n\n2. \"I can't spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best, though. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire.\"\n   - The reviewer states that they have no idea what happened in the film, which suggests that the plot is very confusing. This part seems to be a negative comment on the film's plot.\n\n3. \"Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. There are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions that the characters make no sense, there is no plot, no character development, and random characters appear and disappear. This part is clearly a negative critique of the film's structure and coherence.\n\n4. \"The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity.\"\n   - The \"upside\" section mentions that the lead girls take their shirts off briefly (which might be seen as a positive for some viewers, but it seems like a minor positive point). The reviewer describes the special effects as \"mind-boggling,\" which could be interpreted as a positive term, but the context here seems to be sarcastic because the reviewer mentions that they \"particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences,\" which again seems sarcastic. The \"silly Canadian accent\" is said to add to the \"general level of hilarity,\" which seems to imply that the reviewer found the film funny, but likely because it was so bad that it was funny.\n\n5. \"Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.\"\n   - The reviewer says that the film is \"well worth the price of rental,\" which seems positive. However, the reason given is that \"we laughed until we cried,\" which suggests that the film was so bad that it was funny. \n\nBased on the overall tone of the review, it seems that the reviewer found the film to be so bad that it was entertaining in a \"so bad it's good\" way. However, the question here is whether the sentiment is positive or negative. \n\nThe question statement mentions that if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nBased on the analysis, the reviewer seems to be making fun of the film and pointing out many negative aspects such as a confusing plot, lack of character development, and nonsensical characters. However, the reviewer also seems to find the film entertaining because of how bad it is (\"We laughed until we cried\" and \"Well worth the price of rental\"). \n\nHowever, the question here is to identify the \"sentiment\" of the review. The \"sentiment\" here seems to be a mix of negative comments about the film's quality but a positive comment about the entertainment value derived from its badness. \n\nHowever, a \"positive sentiment\" usually means that the reviewer genuinely liked the film for its intended qualities (e.g., good plot, acting, special effects, etc.), while a \"negative sentiment\" means that the reviewer did not like the film. \n\nHowever, the last sentence \"Well worth the price of rental\" seems\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The \"worst thing\" is not that the acting is bad, the plot is virtually non-existent, or that the camerawork could have been better. \n\n2. \"No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.\"\n   - The \"worst part\" is that the movie has a few \"absolutely brilliant moments\" that make the viewer hope for more such moments. However, the reviewer seems to be saying that the \"brilliant moments\" make the rest of the movie seem worse by comparison because they make the viewer hope for more such moments which do not materialize.\n\n3. \"But in the end, it's too little, too late.\"\n   - The \"brilliant moments\" are described as \"too little, too late,\" which means that the few good moments are not enough to make up for the overall negative experience.\n\n4. \"If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.\"\n   - The reviewer suggests that if you like \"violin-music\" and \"cheap tearjerking scenes\" involving \"40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage,\" you should watch the movie. However, the tone here seems a bit sarcastic or dismissive of such a specific and seemingly \"cheap\" type of scene.\n\n5. \"I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time.\"\n   - The reviewer explicitly states that they are not a fan of the \"cheap tearjerking scenes\" mentioned previously and that they had a \"pretty horrible time\" watching the movie.\n\n6. \"The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.\"\n   - The \"few absolutely brilliant jokes\" (which seems to be a reference to the \"brilliant moments\" mentioned earlier) are not enough to make up for the rest of the movie's flaws.\n\n7. \"The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.\"\n   - The reviewer gives the movie a rating of 4 out of 10 and states that the movie is \"guilty of wasting my time.\"\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall sentiment of the review is negative. The reviewer had a \"pretty horrible time\" watching the movie and feels that it was a waste of time. \n\nBased on the question statement, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1; if it is negative, the answer should be 0.\n\nBased on the reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

I'm a bright guy, but this was just too much for a tired brain.\"\n   - \"Exceedingly complicated and drab\" suggests a negative sentiment.\n   - \"This was just too much for a tired brain\" also suggests a negative sentiment.\n\n2. \"It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing.\"\n   - This suggests that the reviewer found the film confusing and hard to follow, which is another negative point.\n\n3. \"Probably better for the US market.\"\n   - This seems neutral or slightly negative, implying that the film might not be well-received outside the US market.\n\n4. \"GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why.\"\n   - \"GC\" likely refers to George Clooney (as mentioned later in the text). The reviewer is saying that George Clooney hinted that this film alone did not win him an Oscar, and the reviewer agrees (\"you can see why\"), which again seems to be a negative comment on the film.\n\n5. \"Still the sand dunes are pretty.\"\n   - This is a positive comment about the visual aspect of the film (\"sand dunes are pretty\").\n\n6. \"The nail pulling is nasty.\"\n   - \"Nasty\" here seems to be a negative comment about a scene in the film.\n\n7. \"The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery.\"\n   - This seems to be a neutral or slightly negative comment, as it mentions a \"mystery\" which might imply that the part of the story involving the \"attorney's drunk dad\" was not well explained or was confusing.\n\n8. \"The cricket is good to see.\"\n   - Another positive comment (\"good to see\").\n\n9. \"Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this, despite it being over 2 hours long.\"\n   - This suggests that the reviewer found it hard to find enough to say about the film, which seems negative.\n\n10. \"Thank heavens they shortened it.\"\n   - This implies that the reviewer is glad that the film was shortened, which could be interpreted as a negative comment on the film's original length.\n\n11. \"Admittedly we don't get to the pictures much, but the last film we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better and I don't really like Johnny Cash.\"\n   - The reviewer compares the film unfavorably to another film (\"Walk the Line was 10 times better\"), which is a negative comment on the film being reviewed.\n\n12. \"My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that.....am I nearly there yet ? How about now.\"\n   - The only positive part here seems to be that George Clooney still looks good with a beard and a few extra pounds. However, the question \"am I nearly there yet ? How about now\" seems to be a sarcastic remark about reaching the required length for the review.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the review contains a mix of negative and a few positive comments.

            "question": "Given the question statement:\"Who Done It?\" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as \"Pardon My Terror.\") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film.

This part seems to express a negative sentiment about his performance in this specific film.\n   - The part \"and he was one of the better actors\" again praises Christopher Lee in general, but it seems to imply that even a good actor couldn't save the film.\n\n2. \"The film does not live up to its premise.\"\n   - This statement directly states that the film did not meet the reviewer's expectations based on its premise, which is a negative sentiment about the film itself.\n\n3. \"It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags.\"\n   - \"It's not that scary\" suggests that the film failed to deliver on what might be a key part of its intended effect (i.e., being scary).\n   - \"It's overly melodramatic\" indicates that the reviewer found the film to be too dramatic in an exaggerated or artificial way, which is a negative comment.\n   - \"It draaaaaags\" (with the elongated \"draaaaaags\") emphasizes that the film is slow-paced and boring, which is another negative comment.\n\n4. \"Every time I thought, 'Oh, HERE comes the good part' the good part never quite arrived.\"\n   - This part indicates that the reviewer was repeatedly disappointed because the \"good part\" of the film never materialized. This is a negative sentiment about the film's structure and content.\n\n5. \"The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.\"\n   - \"The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing\" suggests that the reviewer found a key part of the film (the \"Evil Ones\") to be poorly executed.\n   - \"Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth\" indicates that the reviewer found the character development in the film to be insufficient, which is another negative comment.\n\n6. \"Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film's expense, but.... Naaahhh... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.\"\n   - \"MSTie-fication\" refers to \"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\" a show where bad movies are mocked. The reviewer suggests that the film might be suitable for such mockery, which implies that the film is bad enough to be made fun of.\n   - \"Didn't really seem to be worth the effort\" indicates that the reviewer did not find the film worth watching or making fun of.\n   - \"It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre\" sums up the reviewer's overall sentiment about the film as \"mediocre,\" which is a negative sentiment because \"mediocre\" means \"of only moderate quality; not very good.\"\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall sentiment of the text is negative. The reviewer makes several negative comments about the film's quality, such as it not living up to its premise, not being scary, being overly melodramatic, dragging on, having unconvincing characters, and being \"mediocre.\" \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, a more thorough check makes us realize that the question is asking us to identify if the sentence is positive (answer is 1) or negative (answer is 0). \n\nBased on the reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.<br /><br />Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.<br /><br />The \"hobgoblins\" are, as you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her \"proud of him.\" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not.

To determine if the review is positive or negative, let us analyze the key statements made in the review:\n\n1. \"I'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review.\"\n   - The phrase \"a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review\" suggests a negative sentiment towards the movie.\n\n2. \"Given the setting, this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another '28 days later' or even a 'Blair Witch Project'.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions that the movie had potential (\"could have been something really special\"), which implies that the movie did not live up to that potential.\n\n3. \"The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited, director did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I don't think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty London Underground.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions being \"really excited\" for the first 20 minutes and acknowledges that the director did a \"decent job\" with cinematography and suspense. However, the statement ends with a criticism that the director did not capture the \"true eeriness of an empty London Underground.\"\n\n4. \"Characters were a big let down. Our 'heroine' in this movie is a worthless piece of crap, and you really don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).\"\n   - The reviewer states that the characters were a \"big let down\" and describes the main character (\"heroine\") as a \"worthless piece of crap\" and mentions that the audience does not care if she dies. The reviewer even mentions that they were \"rooting for the homeless people and the black guy,\" which indicates a lack of connection with the main character and a negative view of the character development.\n\n5. \"The main villain, is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed I was really disappointed. I won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions that the main villain's reveal was disappointing and makes a disparaging comparison that a \"10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match,\" which again indicates a negative sentiment.\n\n6. \"All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark.\"\n   - The reviewer concludes that the movie is \"just another mediocre horror film\" that \"falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula.\" The statement that the film \"had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark\" reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\n7. \"Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY.\"\n   - The reviewer uses the word \"lame\" to describe the movie and criticizes the characters' actions as illogical (\"characters had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY\").\n\nBased on the analysis of the text, the overall sentiment expressed in the review is clearly negative. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Given the question statement:`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment about the movie \"House of Games,\" we need to analyze the text carefully.\n\nThe text starts by introducing \"House of Games\" as the directorial debut of playwright David Mamet and describes it as \"an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller.\" The phrase \"effective and at times surprising psychological thriller\" suggests a positive initial impression.\n\nThe text mentions that the main character, Margaret Ford (played by Lindsay Crouse), \"leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.\" This part seems to be a description of the plot rather than a direct sentiment about the movie itself.\n\nThe text praises Joe Mantegna's performance as Mike, describing it as \"played excellently.\" Another positive remark here.\n\nThe text mentions that what makes \"House of Games\" \"interesting and an essential view for any film fan\" is the \"constant guessing of who is in control.\" The phrase \"interesting and an essential view for any film fan\" is a strong positive statement.\n\nHowever, the text does mention a negative point about the direction of the film, describing it as \"dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring.\" However, it follows this by saying that in Mamet's films, \"it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction.\" Thus, while the direction is criticized, the text seems to imply that the story makes up for it.\n\nThe text also praises the \"superb performances from the two leads\" and mentions that \"it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film.\" Another positive remark here.\n\nThe text describes the film as \"a very satisfying piece of American cinema\" and mentions that the \"final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.\" Another strong positive statement here.\n\nThe text concludes by calling the film \"an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings\" and gives it a rating of \"9/10.\" A rating of 9 out of 10 is a very high score, which indicates a highly positive sentiment.\n\nBased on the overall analysis, the text contains a few negative comments about the direction (\"dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring\"), but the majority of the text is filled with positive remarks such as \"effective and at times surprising psychological thriller,\" \"played excellently,\" \"interesting and an essential view for any film fan,\" \"superb performances,\" \"a very satisfying piece of American cinema,\" \"stunning\" ending, \"extremely enjoyable film experience,\" and a \"9/10\" rating. \n\nThus, the overall sentiment of the text is clearly positive.\n\nBased on the question instructions, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1.\n\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The main points mentioned are:\n\n1. \"Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor.\" The phrase \"is a treat to watch\" indicates a positive sentiment towards Peter O'Toole's performance.\n\n2. \"The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence.\" The phrase \"provides a good foil\" means that Susannah York complements O'Toole well, which again seems positive.\n\n3. \"The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary.\" The phrase \"is able to entertain the viewer\" indicates that the film has a positive effect on the viewer.\n\n4. \"Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances.\" The phrase \"will be remembered for its entertaining performances\" again indicates a positive sentiment towards the performances in the film.\n\n5. \"Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently.\" The phrase \"is a treat to watch\" is used again here for Susannah York's performance, which is a positive comment.\n\n6. \"The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. But the film floats because of the actors and the script.\" The first part mentions a \"possible weakness\" which could be seen as a negative point, but the sentence continues with \"But the film floats because of the actors and the script,\" which again emphasizes a positive aspect of the film.\n\n7. \"I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name 'Brotherly love'. 'Country dance' is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.\" This part seems to be a personal comment on the title of the film rather than a comment on the film itself. The term \"farcical and inappropriate\" is negative, but it only refers to the title \"Country dance\" and not the film itself.\n\nBased on the overall sentiment expressed in the text, the majority of the comments are positive. The only negative comment is about the film's direction (\"Thompson's laid-back direction\"), which is mentioned as a \"possible weakness,\" but the text still concludes that \"the film floats because of the actors and the script.\" \n\nBased on this reasoning, the overall sentiment of the text appears to be positive.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them.

I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film.\"\n   - The first sentence indicates that the author had high hopes for liking the film \"Julian Po.\" However, the use of \"wanted to like\" suggests that the author did not end up liking it.\n   - The second part praises Christian Slater and the supporting actors, but this seems to be a positive comment on the actors rather than the film itself.\n\n2. \"I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter.\"\n   - The author acknowledges that the film is based on a short story which they have not read. They are unsure whether the faults they perceive in the film are due to the original story or the director/screenwriter.\n\n3. \"The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing!\"\n   - The author finds the premise of the film \"wonderful\" and likes the opening narration. However, the \"But then...?

            "question": "Given the question statement:I am currently sitting here, forcing myself to finish this. I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for \"War of the Worlds\" cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90's. The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a \"perfect translation\". Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic \"dramatic pause\" look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.<br /><br />Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk (crappy down even) attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The \"illusion\" of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the \"hero\" gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so in-depth.<br /><br />Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want \"The War of the Worlds\", do one of four things. 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for Spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class).

I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it.\" This part already indicates a negative sentiment because the author mentions \"forcing myself to finish\" and \"might as well suffer for it,\" which implies that watching the movie is a painful experience.\n\nThe next part mentions a search for \"War of the Worlds\" due to rumors about a Spielberg movie and a TV series from the early 90s. The author mentions that a website described a \"multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book\" as a \"perfect translation.\" However, the author immediately counters this by saying, \"Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.\" The use of the word \"CRAP\" clearly indicates a negative sentiment.\n\nThe author then goes on to describe several specific issues with the movie:\n1. \"First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar.\" This part criticizes the video quality negatively.\n2. \"The acting made Shatners classic 'dramatic pause' look damn near Shakespearean in quality.\" This part criticizes the acting negatively by comparing it unfavorably to William Shatner's acting, which is often criticized for being overly dramatic.\n3. \"The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.\" Another negative comment about the CGI and green screen effects.\n4. \"Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video (no promo's at the beginning) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien.\" The author criticizes the pacing of the movie as being too slow.\n5. \"After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid.\" Another negative comment about the CGI used for the alien.\n6. \"The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's.\" Negative comment about the music score.\n7. \"The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's NO ONE is concerned for their life. It's like they have no concept.\" The author criticizes the lack of realistic reactions from the characters in the movie.\n8. \"The 'illusion' of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME.\" Another negative comment about the visual effects used to depict night scenes.\n9. \"THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the 'hero' gallop around or walk down silly roads.

The reviewer makes several points:\n\n1. The reviewer mentions that this is the first Michael Vartan movie they have seen (excluding \"Alias\") and states that \"He sure can [act] and is likable in this movie.\"\n2. The reviewer also mentions that Natasha Henstridge is \"gorgeous\" and usually seen in \"more physical and action roles,\" but here she is in a \"sweet\" role as a schoolteacher where she is described as \"very good and lovable.\"\n3. The reviewer acknowledges that some negative comments they read are true, such as the movie being \"full of clich\u00e9s\" and that the story \"doesn't ring true at all.\" Additionally, the reviewer mentions that there is a lack of \"screen chemistry\" between the main characters, despite other characters in the movie remarking on how good they look together.\n4. Despite the negative points, the reviewer states that they \"enjoyed this movie.\" They mention that the \"locales are nice,\" the \"characters are likable and goodlooking,\" and that the \"supporting actors are pretty good.\"\n5.

However, the reviewer also mentions that they \"enjoyed this movie\" and that it is a \"pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters\" which they describe as \"very good.\" \n\nBased on the overall tone and the fact that the reviewer mentions that they \"enjoyed this movie\" and that it is \"very good\" for a \"pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters,\" the overall sentiment seems to be positive.\n\nHowever, it is important to make a balanced judgment here. The reviewer makes a point that the movie is not a \"great romance\" but still seems to find it enjoyable overall. \n\nBased on the question, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1.

            "question": "Given the question statement:SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel\u0085if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs! And Grendel's mother\u0085did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /><br />If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic\u0085.don't, as there really isn't one (other than character names).

The author mentions that \"Grendel\" deviates so much from the epic \"Beowulf\" that the advertisements might as well have titled it \"some shitty Christopher Lambert movie.\"\n2. The author states that they \"wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production,\" but they did expect that \"artistic integrity\" should not interfere with the actual story. However, the author feels that the movie did not meet this expectation.\n3. The author questions whether the director and producers did any research, pointing out inaccuracies such as \"massive horned helmets\" worn by Beowulf and his crew.\n4. Another major issue the author has is with the portrayal of Grendel. The author questions how Beowulf could wrestle a Grendel who is \"sixteen feet tall and weigh[s] 2 tons.\"\n5. The author criticizes the way Grendel dies in the movie, which differs from the epic where Beowulf rips out Grendel's arm from the socket. In the movie, Grendel's arm is \"cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs.\"\n6. The author also mentions that Grendel's mother seems to be combined with the dragon from the end of the epic where Beowulf eventually dies from his wounds.\n7. The author makes a sarcastic comment about a character's mullet.\n8. The author concludes by advising that if someone wants to see the movie because of its connection to the epic \"Beowulf,\" they should not, as there is hardly any connection other than character names.

The part \"and will watch it again\" reinforces the positive sentiment because the speaker is expressing a desire to rewatch the movie, which suggests a strong positive opinion.\n\n2. \"Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self.\"\n   - The phrase \"Original twist\" suggests that the plot has a unique or innovative aspect, which is usually seen as a positive comment on the movie's plot.\n\n3. \"I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie.\"\n   - Saying that a movie is an actor's \"best movie\" is a very positive statement about the movie and Kurt Russell's performance in it.\n\n4. \"His eyes conveyed more than most actors words.\"\n   - This sentence praises Kurt Russell's acting, specifically his ability to convey emotions through his eyes.

However, the part \"there's hope for Mankind\" is a positive statement.

This part of the sentence suggests a strong emotional response, which is usually a positive sign when referring to a movie or a story.\n\n2. \"Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.\"\n   - The term \"unforgettable rendering\" means that the way the story was presented was so impactful that it left a lasting impression. \"Unforgettable\" is a positive adjective here.\n   - The part \"which is unknown to most people\" simply states that the wartime story is not well-known, which is a neutral fact and does not directly contribute to a positive or negative sentiment.\n\n3. \"The performances were faultless and outstanding.\"\n   - \"Faultless\" means without any mistakes or flaws, which is a highly positive term.\n   - \"Outstanding\" is also a positive adjective, indicating that the performances were exceptionally good.\n\nBased on the analysis of the sentence, the overall sentiment appears to be positive. The key positive words and phrases here are \"overtaken by emotion,\" \"unforgettable rendering,\" \"faultless,\" and \"outstanding.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n(1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment).\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Ben and Arthur has beaten both.\"\n   - The \"bottom 100\" on IMDb refers to the 100 worst-rated movies. The author mentions that they thought \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" or the \"Roller Ball\" remake were the worst movies they had seen until they saw \"Ben and Arthur,\" which they claim is even worse.\n\n2. \"This out of the many countless amount of movies I've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw. Bad Directing ,Bad Characters ,Horrible Acting ,Horrible story There's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film.\"\n   - The author states that \"Ben and Arthur\" is the \"number one worst film\" they have ever seen. They criticize the \"Bad Directing,\" \"Bad Characters,\" \"Horrible Acting,\" and \"Horrible story.\" They also mention that \"nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film,\" which implies that the general consensus is negative.\n\n3. \"Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.\"\n   - The author continues to criticize Sam, calling him a \"horrible annoying actor\" and stating that his directing was so bad that it might \"overthrow Ed Wood.\" Ed Wood is often considered one of the worst directors in history, so this is a very negative comparison.\n\n4. \"The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued stars.\"\n   - The author states that the director should be \"ashamed of his work\" and mentions that they \"have to give it at least 1 star\" (which seems to be a minimum rating requirement on IMDb where the lowest rating is one star), but they believe the film deserves even less than one star (\"it deserves - to be continued stars\").\n\nBased on the analysis, the text is filled with negative comments about the film \"Ben and Arthur.\" The author makes it clear that they think the film is extremely bad and that it might be the worst film they have ever seen.\n\nBased on the question statement (\"If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\"), the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Saying that \"The Sopranos\" is \"as good as\" Goodfellas and Casino and \"almost as good as The Godfather\" is a very positive statement. The part \"hence not a '10'\" indicates that the reviewer thinks \"The Godfather\" might be a \"10,\" so \"The Sopranos\" is almost that good but not quite a \"10.\" The statement that it is \"far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts\" is another positive comparison.\n\n3. \"Although there's plenty of action, some of it pretty bloody, the story is character driven.\"\n    - This part mentions that the story is \"character driven,\" which is often seen as a positive attribute for a TV series or film.\n\n4. \"Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines; e.g. the priest's relationship (or lack of) with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last very long (a Darwin Award nominee?))\"\n    - The mention that \"minor characters contribute to great story lines\" is a positive comment.\n\n5. \"Apart from the plot, the script and the acting, the other reasons I liked it;\"\n    - The reviewer explicitly states that they \"liked it,\" which is a clear positive sentiment.\n\n6. \"1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 2. The music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.\"\n    - The first point here (\"It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce\") indicates that the show had a positive impact on the reviewer's desires.\n    - The second point (\"The music\") is a bit vague, but it seems to be a positive mention of the show's music.\n    - The third point (\"It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems\") seems to be a neutral or positive observation about the show's realistic portrayal of mental health issues.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall sentiment expressed in the text is clearly positive. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, let us verify once again if there are any negative sentiments mentioned explicitly. The only part that might be interpreted as a negative is the part where the reviewer mentions that \"The Sopranos\" is \"almost as good as The Godfather (hence not a '10').\" However, this is still a positive statement because it implies that \"The Sopranos\" is very close to being as good as a \"10\" (which is a high praise).\n\nBased on the reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The text mentions that the creature appears in about thirty seconds of \"marginal stop-motion animation,\" but for the rest of the movie, the animation is replaced by \"production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth.\" \n\nThe text also mentions that there is \"no time for terror\" because the movie is \"hijacked halfway through by comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters.\" However, the text states that \"watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff.\" \n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that \"only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness,\" which is described as \"no fun.\"\n\nBased on the given text, the main points seem to be:\n1. The stop-motion animation only appears for thirty seconds and is described as \"marginal.\"\n2. For the rest of the movie, the animation is replaced by \"production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth,\" which seems to be a negative comment on the quality of the special effects.\n3. The movie is \"hijacked\" by \"comic relief boat rental doofuses\" who become the lead characters halfway through the movie.\n4. The text mentions that \"watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff,\" which seems to imply that the \"comic relief\" part is still not great, but it is \"better\" than another part of the movie which is described as \"plodding around after the sheriff.\"\n5. The ending where one of the \"comic relief\" characters gets eaten and the other is left \"crying tears of loneliness\" is described as \"no fun.\"\n\nBased on the negative descriptions such as \"marginal stop-motion animation,\" \"production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth,\" \"no time for terror,\" \"comic relief boat rental doofuses,\" \"plodding around after the sheriff,\" and the \"no fun\" ending, it seems that the overall sentiment of the text is negative.\n\nHowever, the question states that if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1, and if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, let us make sure that our reasoning is sound. \n\nThe question seems to be asking us to identify the sentiment of the review. The review seems to be making fun of the movie's poor special effects (\"inner tube with teeth\"), the uninteresting main characters (\"plodding around after the sheriff\"), and a \"no fun\" ending. Thus, the overall sentiment appears to be negative.\n\nHowever, a more in-depth check might be necessary here. Another part of the text says, \"oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth.\" This part seems to be a sarcastic way of saying that the stop-motion animation part, although marginal, is still better than what follows (\"inner tube with teeth\"). Another part says, \"watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff,\" which again seems to be a comparison where one part is \"better\" than another part, but both parts seem to be described negatively (\"try to be funny\" implies that they are not actually funny, and \"plodding around after the sheriff\" sounds boring).\n\nBased on the negative tone throughout the text, the answer should indeed be negative (0).\n\nHowever, a more \"positive\" part might be \"watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff,\" which seems to be a relative comparison where one part is \"better\" than another part. However, \"better\" here only means that one part is less bad than another part. The overall sentiment still seems negative.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

All in all, disappointment.\"\n\nThe question asks us to identify whether the sentiment expressed in the text is positive (answer is 1) or negative (answer is 0).\n\nLet us break down the text sentence by sentence:\n\n1. \"This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here.\"\n   - The phrase \"has its ups and occasional downs\" means that the series has both good and bad parts. However, \"the latter is the case, here\" means that the \"downs\" part is what applies to this particular installment of the series. Thus, the first sentence indicates that this part of the series is one of the \"downs.\"\n\n2. \"There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual.\"\n   - \"There's an agreeable amount of spatter\" could be seen as a positive comment (\"agreeable\" suggests something that is acceptable or even pleasant).\n   - \"Inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons\" also seems positive (\"inventive\" suggests creativity and a positive aspect).\n   - However, the sentence continues with \"but,\" which indicates a contrast. The part after \"but\" states that \"the editing film is a seriously disjointed\" and \"the film-making itself rougher than usual.\" Both \"seriously disjointed\" and \"rougher than usual\" are negative comments about the editing and film-making.\n\n3. \"At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the 'cub,' who nearly gets lost early on.\"\n   - \"The action slows to a crawl\" is a negative comment because it suggests that the action scenes are very slow and possibly boring.\n   - \"The camera follows the wordless wanderings of the 'cub,' who nearly gets lost early on\" could be interpreted as a negative comment because it seems to imply that the part focusing on the \"cub\" is not engaging or well-executed.\n\n4. \"All in all, disappointment.\"\n   - The phrase \"All in all\" is used to summarize the overall sentiment, which is described as \"disappointment.\" This clearly indicates a negative overall sentiment.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the text is negative. \n\nHowever, there is a second part of the text that seems to provide a slightly more positive note:\n\"That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.\"\n\n1. \"That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers.\"\n   - \"That said\" is a phrase used to introduce a contrasting point. The \"spaghetti eastern quality\" (which seems to be a play on \"spaghetti western,\" a genre known for its stylized action and music) might be appealing to \"dedicated viewers.\" However, this part seems to be a minor positive note aimed at a specific audience (\"dedicated viewers\").\n\n2. \"This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.\"\n   - This part seems to describe the plot focus on the little boy's \"minor misadventures\" and his \"stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.\" This part seems more descriptive than evaluative, but it does not seem to be a positive comment.\n\nHowever, the main part of the text that seems to summarize the overall sentiment is the part that ends with \"All in all, disappointment.\" Thus, the main part of the text seems to be negative.\n\nBased on the question statement, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1; if it is negative, the answer should be 0.

Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got \"Cult Status\" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling here, I know. I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment, we need to analyze the key parts of the text.\n\nThe text states:\n1. The author vaguely recalls seeing a movie when they were 3 years old, which their parents accidentally taped over with another cartoon.\n2. At age 8 or 9, the author rediscovered the movie and thought it was a good movie because they were able to comprehend things better at that age.\n3. A few weeks ago (June 2006), the author rediscovered the movie again through internet articles and video clips and found that \"it's just not the same movie.\"\n4. The author mentions that the movie is \"still good with the kids,\" but for people in their 20s to 30s, it has \"Cult Status\" written all over it.\n5. The author feels it's a shame that the original production went through a painful process and believes that if Fox had given it enough time, it would probably be more recognized today.\n6. The author suggests that a remake with a totally different story and an all-star voice cast might make it better recognized, but that's for Fox to decide.\n7. The author concludes by saying, \"I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the main points to focus on are:\n- \"I thought it was a good movie then\" (positive sentiment from childhood).\n- \"I re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie\" (seems like a negative sentiment about the current perception of the movie).\n- \"I'm sure it's still good with the kids\" (positive sentiment for kids).\n- \"to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got 'Cult Status' written all over it\" (seems like a neutral to positive sentiment for a specific age group).\n- \"It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process\" (negative sentiment about the production process).\n- \"if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today\" (positive potential that was not realized).\n- \"I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great\" (positive sentiment overall, as the author still thinks it's a \"great film,\" but also mentions that it could be \"better than great.\"\n\nBased on the overall sentiment expressed in the text, the author seems to have a generally positive view of the movie (\"I Still think it's a great film\"), although there are some negative aspects mentioned such as the \"painful process\" and the fact that \"it's just not the same movie\" upon rediscovery. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive one because the author still thinks it's a \"great film.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, let us make sure that the \"it's just not the same movie\" part is interpreted correctly. The phrase \"it's just not the same movie\" could be interpreted as a negative sentiment about the current perception compared to the past. However, the author still concludes that they think it's a \"great film,\" which makes the overall sentiment positive.\n\nHowever, a more careful reading makes us realize that \"it's just not the same movie\" might be a negative sentiment about the movie itself now that the author is older. However, the part where the author says \"it's still good with the kids\" and \"I still think it's a great film\" makes us lean towards a positive sentiment overall. \n\nHowever, \"it's just not the same movie\" might be a negative sentiment about the author's current perception of the movie compared to their childhood memories. However, the part where the author says \"I still think it's a great film\" makes us lean towards a positive sentiment overall. \n\nBased on the question, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1. Thus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, a more in-depth analysis makes us question what \"it's just not the same movie\" means. It seems that the author is saying that the movie does not hold up as well now that they are older (\"20-30 somethings\"), yet they still call it a \"great film.\" \n\nHowever, \"it's just not the same movie\" could be interpreted as a negative sentiment about the movie itself now that the author is older. However, the part where the author says \"it's still good with the kids\" and \"I still think it's a great film\" makes us lean towards a positive sentiment overall. \n\nHowever, \"it's just not the same movie\" might be a negative sentiment about the author's current perception of the movie compared to their childhood memories.

The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, Jimmy Stewart, Bill Mauldin, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten, Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in \"The Making of The World at War\" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff.

The statement \"This deserves a lot better treatment\" suggests that the author believes the film should have been given a better DVD release.\n\n2. \"The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and winds up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) ....and the problems that ensue afterward.

The little girl is described as a \"cutie,\" which is a positive term. However, the author mentions that they \"usually like a nice sentimental ending\" but feels that the film \"gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes,\" which seems to be a slight negative comment on the ending.\n\n4. \"Overall, it's involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness.

This movie is in the same niche genre as \"Away from Her\" - or even \"The Bucket List\" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos.

The text starts with: \"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried.\" This part clearly indicates a positive initial reaction to the movie.\n\n2. The text mentions that the movie handles the \"aging theme with incredible authenticity\" and that \"The director does a masterful job with the challenge\" of making a main character who is \"unlikable\" and \"hard to understand.\" These are positive comments about the movie's handling of a difficult subject and the director's skill.\n\n3. The text describes the main character, Hagar, as \"unlikable,\" \"hard to understand,\" \"mean,\" \"belittling,\" \"selfish,\" and \"a stone.\" However, these descriptions are part of the analysis of the character and not a direct negative comment on the movie itself. \n\n4. The text mentions that \"I didn't like her - not even a little bit\" initially, but later states, \"I started to see the angel... and I started to like her.\" The text also praises Ellen Burnstyn's acting, calling her a \"brilliant actor\" and giving \"kudos\" for a particular scene where Hagar pours out her secrets to a boy in a shack.\n\n5. The text states that \"This isn't a 'feel good' movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy.\" This indicates that while the movie might not be uplifting, it is effective in making the viewer empathize with the main character.\n\n6. The text concludes by saying that parts of Hagar's character are present in many people in the author's life and that those parts make more sense now after watching the movie.

The reviewer mentions that they \"couldn't pass up the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together,\" which seems like a positive initial interest in the movie.\n2. The reviewer refers to the movie as a \"mess of a movie,\" which is a negative comment.\n3.

The reviewer was \"surprised at how mediocre this movie was,\" which is a negative comment.\n5. The reviewer found the story \"difficult to follow\" because it was \"slow,\" which is another negative comment.\n6. The reviewer mentions that \"Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters,\" which is a positive comment about the actors' performances.\n7. The reviewer \"flounder[s] to recommend this as a must see,\" which indicates that they are hesitant to strongly recommend the movie, which seems like a negative sentiment.\n8. The reviewer mentions that \"it is a great story of Australian history\" and that \"the film does have some good action sequences,\" which are positive comments.\n9. The reviewer gives the movie a \"6/10\" rating, which is a slightly above-average score (since 5/10 would be a neutral \"average\" score on a 1-10 scale).\n10. The reviewer says \"see it for historical value\" but follows it with a sarcastic comment: \"(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )\". The sarcastic part seems to imply that the reviewer does not actually believe that the historical value is a strong enough reason to see the movie.\n\nBased on the analysis, the review contains a mix of positive and negative comments. However, the overall tone seems to lean more towards the negative. The reviewer calls the movie a \"mess,\" describes it as \"mediocre,\" and mentions that the story is \"slow\" and \"difficult to follow.\" Although there are some positive comments about the actors' performances and the historical story, the overall sentiment seems to be that the movie itself was not well made or engaging.\n\nHowever, a \"6/10\" rating is slightly above average, which might make us lean towards a more neutral or slightly positive sentiment. However, the \"6/10\" rating itself might be a bit misleading here because the reviewer seems to be more negative overall. \n\nHowever, the question here is to identify if the sentence is positive or negative. The most important part here is the last part where the reviewer says \"6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )\". The \"yeah right\" part seems to be a sarcastic remark, which makes us question the \"6/10\" part. \n\nHowever, a \"6/10\" rating is still a \"passing\" grade (i.e., a bit above average), so it seems that the reviewer is not entirely negative about the movie. However, the \"6/10\" seems to be a \"mediocre\" rating which might be a \"neutral\" score. \n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking us to make a binary choice here: positive (1) or negative (0). \n\nBased on the negative comments such as \"mess of a movie,\" \"mediocre,\" \"slow,\" and \"difficult to follow,\" the overall sentiment seems to\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The reviewer makes several observations:\n\n1. The movie has one of the strangest themes in history, comparing it to Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\" which had a theme about cross-dressing.\n2. The subject of the movie is playing bridge, which is played by various groups such as the Park Avenue set, the Bohemians, and the Russians who work at a restaurant.\n3. The reviewer mentions that the Russians speak \"questionable 'Russian'\" and have \"unconvincing accents\" when they speak English.\n4. The reviewer states that if one isn't interested in bridge, one isn't likely to be much interested in the movie, despite the great cast.\n5. The reviewer mentions that Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine actors, but notes that Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer and that Paul Lukas is an unlikely Russian.\n6. The reviewer concludes that all the actors are \"sunk by the fetishistic script.\"\n\nBased on the given text, the main sentiment seems to be negative. The reviewer makes several negative remarks such as \"strangest themes,\" \"questionable 'Russian,'\" \"unconvincing accents,\" and the statement that if one isn't interested in bridge, one isn't likely to be interested in the movie. The final sentence \"But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script\" clearly indicates a negative sentiment about the movie overall.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{0}\nHowever, let us make sure that the reasoning is well understood. \n\nThe question asks us to identify if the sentence is positive (answer should be 1) or negative (answer should be 0). The main negative points are:\n- \"strangest themes in history\" (negative connotation)\n- \"questionable 'Russian'\" (negative)\n- \"unconvincing accents\" (negative)\n- \"If one isn't interested in bridge, one isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie\" (suggests that the movie is only interesting if one is already interested in bridge, which is a negative remark about the movie's broader appeal)\n- \"But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script\" (strong negative remark about the script ruining the performances of a great cast)\n\nBased on this, the answer should be negative (0).\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The reviewer makes several points:\n\n1. \"This is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.\"\n   - The reviewer mentions that the \"amusing\" part is only \"at first,\" which suggests that the initial amusement might not be a lasting positive sentiment. However, the main part of this sentence seems to be about the \"decadent futuristic world\" where \"many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.\" This part seems to be a negative observation about the world depicted in the movie.\n\n2. \"Characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect.

However, the description itself (\"no tact or manners or respect\") seems negative.\n\n3. \"I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies.\"\n   - The reviewer explicitly states that they \"didn't like most of the action scenes,\" except for the death of the priest.

Thus, the overall sentiment is positive.\n\nHowever, a more \"balanced\" review might make us question if the \"positive\" part is the main sentiment here.

The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of \"real teen life.\" Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, \"a film teens should see because it's about them.\" Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like \"Pups\" or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed responsive.

This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater. Only \"Wargames\" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future. History has shown that this is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to \"run\" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as \"Captain Freedom\" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as \"Subzero,\" both \"stalkers\" who kill the \"running men.\" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the \"dancers of the future\" are none other than the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS \"80s.\" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as \"contestants.\" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.<br /><br />The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for \"national security\" is downright chilling. Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.<br /><br />The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the \"ravine\" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. \"Serious\" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their \"common man\" counterparts, such as this one.<br /><br />An absolute must-see.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment about the movie \"The Running Man,\" we need to analyze the main points made in the text.\n\n1.

The text starts by saying that one should not expect credibility in action movies where the superhero performs unbelievable feats, especially when directed by Renny Harlin.\n2. The text states that \"Cliffhanger\" is no exception to this lack of credibility.\n3. However, the text mentions that the movie has numerous assets such as:\n    - Breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed.\n    - Stunning special and visual effects (with a mention that the first five minutes are gripping and set the tone of the film).\n    - An excellent musical score.\n    - Welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension.\n    - A solid cast including Sylvester Stallone, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, and a \"darstardy bunch of villains\" including John Lithgow and Caroline Goodall.\n4. The text concludes by calling the movie \"Good, solid entertainment\" if one does not expect credibility. It also quotes Roger Ebert saying that it's the kind of movie you can enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\n\nBased on the analysis, the text seems to be a mixed review where the reviewer acknowledges the lack of credibility in the movie but also highlights many positive aspects such as the scenery, special effects, musical score, and cast. The reviewer concludes that the movie is \"Good, solid entertainment\" if one does not focus on the lack of credibility.\n\nBased on the question statement, if the sentence is positive, the answer should be 1; if it is negative, the answer should be 0. \n\nThe overall tone seems to be more positive than negative. The reviewer acknowledges some negative points (lack of credibility) but seems to lean towards a positive view overall (\"Good, solid entertainment\"). \n\nBased on this, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, let us make sure that the main sentiment is indeed positive. The main negative point mentioned is the lack of credibility, which is a common issue in action movies according to the reviewer. However, the reviewer seems to accept that as part of the genre (\"You must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats\"). \n\nThe main part that makes us lean towards a positive sentiment is the part where the reviewer mentions \"numerous assets\" such as \"breathtaking scenery,\" \"stunning special and visual effects,\" \"excellent musical score,\" \"welcome attempts at levity,\" and a \"solid cast.\" The conclusion that it is \"Good, solid entertainment\" if one does not make the mistake of thinking too much also seems to be a positive endorsement.\n\nThus, a positive sentiment seems to be the most accurate interpretation here.\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.If you think this sentence is positive, the answer is 1, and the negative answer is 0\n\nUse following thought to solve it:To solve for whether the given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment about the film \"THE LAST WAVE\" directed by Peter Weir, we need to analyze the key phrases used in the text.\n\nThe text states:\n\"Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.\"\n\nThe phrase \"first international success\" suggests a positive sentiment. The phrase \"mainly effective chiller\" also seems positive (\"effective\" is a positive descriptor, although \"mainly\" suggests that it is not entirely effective, which might be a slight negative, but overall, \"mainly effective\" still leans positive). The phrase \"fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth\" is also positive (\"fascinating\" is a positive descriptor).\n\nThe text continues:\n\"Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance\" is a positive statement (\"good performance\" is a positive descriptor).\n\nThe next part:\n\"David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom.\"\n\nThis part seems neutral, mainly providing a description of the plot and a character's role.\n\nThe next part:\n\"Heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations.\"\n\nThe phrase \"heavy on atmosphere\" could be seen as a positive attribute for a \"chiller\" film. \"Deliberately ambiguous in plotting\" could be either positive or negative depending on the viewer's taste, but it seems like a neutral or slightly positive description here because it contributes to the \"unsettling\" nature of the film. However, the phrase \"unsettling finale\" could be seen as a positive attribute for a \"chiller\" film because it makes the film more effective in creating a sense of dread. However, the part \"which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations\" is a negative statement (\"poor effects\" is a negative descriptor, although it is \"somewhat diminished,\" which means that the negative impact is not too severe).\n\nThe last part:\n\"Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Nevertheless an intriguing film\" is a positive statement (\"intriguing\" is a positive descriptor). The part \"whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you\" is also positive (\"overall impression of mystery and dread\" that \"will stay with you\" suggests that the film makes a lasting impact, which is usually a positive attribute for a film).\n\nBased on the overall analysis, the text seems to be mostly positive about the film despite some minor criticisms such as \"poor effects\" which \"somewhat diminish\" the \"unsettling finale.\" However, the overall tone seems to be positive (\"intriguing film,\" \"fascinating back story,\" \"good performance,\" \"mainly effective chiller,\" and a lasting impression).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, let us make a more structured summary of the positive and negative points mentioned:\n\nPositive points:\n1. \"first international success\"\n2. \"mainly effective chiller\"\n3. \"fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth\"\n4. \"Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance\"\n5. \"Heavy on atmosphere\"\n6. \"deliberately ambiguous in plotting\" (could be seen as a positive for a chiller film)\n7. \"unsettling finale\" (which could be seen as a positive for a chiller film)\n8. \"Nevertheless an intriguing film\"\n9. \"overall impression of mystery and dread... will stay with you\"\n\nNegative points:\n1. \"somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations\"\n\nThe negative point seems to be a minor criticism compared to the overall positive tone of the review.

Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended music video.\"\n   - The first part mentions that Prince was \"one of the hottest acts around\" and that \"Everyone wanted to see this movie.\" This part seems to have a positive connotation.\n\n2. \"The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time?\"\n   - The part \"The acting was pretty bad\" is a negative statement. However, the part \"but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time?\" seems to be a justification or an excuse for the bad acting, which makes the negative part seem less severe.\n\n3. \"Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film!\"\n   - The phrase \"Despite that\" refers to the previously mentioned negative point about the bad acting. However, the main part here is \"it was still a very entertaining film!\" which is a positive statement.\n\n4. \"Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy, especially their rendition of 'The Password', which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their 'who's on first' baseball routine.\"\n   - This part mentions that Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide \"some all time classic comedy\" and makes a positive comparison to Abbott & Costello's famous \"who's on first\" routine. This part is also positive.\n\n5. \"Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. Plus, she is very attractive.\"\n   - This part mentions \"beautiful breasts\" and \"brief nudity\" covered, and that \"she is very attractive.\" This part seems to be a positive comment on the visual appeal of the film.\n\n6. \"And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded.\"\n   - This part states that the soundtrack is \"one of the best Prince ever recorded,\" which is a very positive statement.\n\n7. \"Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.\"\n   - The part \"he was at the top of his game\" is a positive statement about Prince's career at the time of the movie's release.\n\n8. \"This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.\"\n   - The part \"This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category\" is a negative statement, but it is followed by \"but it is pretty entertaining,\" which is a positive statement. The \"but\" here makes the main point of the sentence that the movie is \"pretty entertaining.\"\n\nBased on the overall analysis, the text contains a mix of positive and negative comments. However, the negative comments (such as \"The acting was pretty bad\" and \"This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category\") are often followed by positive statements that seem to outweigh the negative ones (\"Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film!\" and \"but it is pretty entertaining.\"). \n\nThe main sentiment seems to be that while there are some negative aspects (like bad acting), the overall sentiment is that the movie is \"entertaining\" and has many positive aspects such as a great soundtrack, classic comedy, and visual appeal. \n\nBased on this, the overall sentiment of the text appears to be positive. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\nHowever, a more in-depth check confirms that the main sentiment is positive because the reviewer concludes that the movie is \"very entertaining\" and \"pretty entertaining,\" which are positive conclusions despite some negative remarks.\n\nHowever, a more structured way to make a final check is to identify the main conclusion of the review. The last sentence states, \"This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.\" The \"but\" here makes the main point that the movie is \"pretty entertaining,\" which is a positive sentiment. \n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n\nExamples: \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
