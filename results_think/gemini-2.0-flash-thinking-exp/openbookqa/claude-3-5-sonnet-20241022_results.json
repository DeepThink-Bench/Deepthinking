Let's analyze each option carefully:\n\n   - Naptime (A): Animals keep their hair/fur during sleep for protection and warmth\n   - Lunchtime (B): Eating has no direct correlation with hair removal\n   - Mating season (C): While some animals may change their coat during mating season, complete removal isn't typical\n   - Scorching climates (D): This is a natural adaptation where animals shed excess fur to:\n     * Regulate body temperature\n     * Prevent overheating\n     * Adapt to hot weather conditions\n\n3. Looking at real-world examples:\n   * Dogs shed their thick winter coats when summer approaches\n   * Sheep naturally shed wool in hot weather\n   * Many mammals have thinner summer coats compared to winter coats\n\n4.

Polar bears are white to blend in with the snow, but the question asks about the *reason* they are white, which is genetic.\nD. fur length - Fur length doesn't determine the color.\n\nThe most appropriate answer is A, characteristic, because the white color is an inherited characteristic.
